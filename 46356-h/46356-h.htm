<p class="center"><span class="xl">THE TOXICITY OF CAFFEIN.</span></p>
<hr class="small"/>


<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Comparative physiology has established the fundamental fact that
some properties are common to all forms of living matter. But the
same method of inquiry has also led to the recognition of marked
differences in the physiological processes of various species of animals.
Among the most important investigations which contributed to the
knowledge of such variation of function are the studies in comparative
metabolism. It is now recognized that metabolism is in some
respects quite different in herbivora and in carnivora. Some forms
of oxidation are much greater in the rabbit than in cats and dogs.
Nuclein metabolism presents important differences in the rabbit and in
man, while the mode of neutralizing acid in the body may be cited as
another variation in the metabolism of these forms. Perhaps the
most striking examples of differences in the metabolism of different
organisms is furnished by the results of studies on the fate of certain
poisons introduced into the body.</p>

<p>The classical experiments of Bunge and Schmiedeberg<a href="#a15"><sup>15</sup></a><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> on the synthesis
of hippuric acid are of interest in this regard. It will be recalled
that in the dog the synthesis takes place in the kidney; the rabbit is able
to form hippuric acid in the liver as well as in the kidney, while frogs
can synthesize hippuric acid even when both of these organs have been
removed or excluded from the circulation. Observations on the fate
of some of the alcohols of the fatty acid series have likewise shown that
these substances may be combined with glycuronic acid in some animals
but not in others. According to Thierfelder and Von Mering,<a href="#a84"><sup>84</sup></a> tertiary
alcohols are combined in this manner in the rabbit but not in the
dog. According to Neubauer,<a href="#a64"><sup>64</sup></a> the primary and secondary alcohols
are so combined in the dog as well as in the rabbit, but to a greater
degree in the latter.</p>

<p>Pohl<a href="#a73"><sup>73</sup></a> found that amyl alcohol is largely eliminated by the lungs in
the cat and in the dog. The protocols of his experiments show that
65 per cent of the alcohol given these animals was thus recovered,
while he recovered only 22 per cent of this substance in the expired
air of the rabbit. Examination of the urine showed the presence of
glycuronic acid. Hofmeister's<a href="#a37"><sup>37</sup></a> work with tellurium in the dog is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
interest in this connection. He made the important discovery that
some animals possess the power of methylation as well as of demethylation.
Abderhalden and Brahm's<a href="#a1"><sup>1</sup></a> experiments with pyridin show
that the same is true of young dogs when on a meat diet. His experiments
on rabbits with this substance were negative.</p>

<p>The metabolism of caffein and theobromin furnish another illustration
of differences in the physiological mechanism of animals. Although
the substances found in the urine of man, dog, and rabbit after
the administration of caffein and theobromin were the same, the quantities
varied considerably. According to Krüger and Schmidt,<a href="#a47"><sup>47</sup></a> over
14 per cent of the theobromin introduced into the rabbit is eliminated
as 7-methyl xanthin in the urine. The dog eliminates only about 0.67
per cent. On the other hand, the amount of tri-methyl xanthin eliminated
was only 3 per cent in the dog and not quite 1 per cent in the
rabbit.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, from studies in comparative metabolism,
whether endogenous or exogenous, that well-marked physiologic and
chemical differences exist in various species of animals. That pharmacological
action may likewise vary in different species of animals
is shown by the following investigations. According to Guinard,<a href="#a31"><sup>31</sup></a>
who made an exhaustive study of morphin, the reaction to this alkaloid
varies in different forms of life, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
He established its narcotic effect in the dog, rabbit, guinea
pig, white mice, and rats, while for the cat, horse, ox, sheep, hog, and
goat it is, on the contrary, a stimulant. Moreover, there is no evidence
of cerebral effect. The stimulating effect of morphin on the
nervous system in some animals was also observed by Noe<a href="#a65"><sup>65</sup></a> in experiments
with this substance on the hedgehog.</p>

<p>Guinard<a href="#a29"><sup>29</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a href="#a30"><sup>30</sup></a> has also shown that morphin has no narcotic effect in
the marmot, although this animal is very sensitive to the drug. Two
milligrams per kilo were found to be a surely fatal dose for this animal.
His experiments on the comparative toxicity of morphin<a href="#a30"><sup>30,</sup></a> <a href="#a31"><sup>31</sup></a> show a
considerable range of variation in different species. Thus the fatal
dose for the dog was found to be 0.65 per kilo, while 7 mg per kilo is
the fatal dose for the horse. About twice the amount is fatal for the
ox and 0.2 mg per kilo kills the pig. Experiments with other drugs has
shown that a considerable range of variation in resistance exists in
animals of different species.</p>

<p>Noe's<a href="#a65"><sup>65</sup></a> studies on the comparative toxicity of chloral brought out
the interesting fact that the rabbit is more resistant to it than the
hedgehog and the latter more resistant than the guinea pig. Perhaps
the most striking example of a difference in reaction of the
same substance in widely different species is that furnished by
apocodein, quinin, and yohimbin. According to Gunn<a href="#a32"><sup>32</sup></a> these sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>stances
have been found to cause vasodilation in warm-blooded
animals, but they constrict the blood vessels of the frog.</p>

<p>Experiments with apomorphin likewise show that the reaction to
this substance varies in different species of animals. The resistance
of the cat to this drug is, according to Guinard<a href="#a31"><sup>31</sup></a>, ten times greater than
that of the dog, and the latter is more sensitive than the rabbit to
the crystalline form of apomorphin when given intravenously.
According to Kobert<a href="#a45"><sup>45</sup></a> amygdalin is without effect on dogs, but it
is poisonous to rabbits. Lapicque<a href="#a49"><sup>49</sup></a> found that the toxicity of
curara varies in different species of frogs, the dose required to produce
paralysis in <i>Rana esculenta</i> being three times greater than in
<i>Bufo vulgaris</i>. Weir Mitchell<a href="#a59"><sup>59</sup></a> pointed out long ago that turtles
stand enormous doses of curara. Schmiedeberg's experiments with
caffein on <i>Rana temporaria</i> and <i>Rana esculenta</i> (and more recently
those of Jacobi and Golowinski<a href="#a42"><sup>42</sup></a> with caffein, theobromin, and
theophyllin) are also of interest in this connection. These experimenters
observed well-marked differences of reaction to methyl-xanthins
in these closely allied forms.</p>

<p>Experiments with quinin have shown that the action of this substance
differs in some animals. It causes a fall of temperature immediately
after its administration in the guinea pig, but frequently
produces, at first, a rise of temperature, followed by an unimportant
fall, in rabbits, dogs, and man.</p>

<p>The numerous investigations which have been carried out on the
effect of atoxyl within recent years have contributed much to the
comparative pharmacology of this substance. Although the symptoms
and organic changes produced by this substance in a variety of
animals present no great differences, the resistance of some has been
found to vary; according to Köster<a href="#a46"><sup>46</sup></a> it is more toxic for dogs than
for rabbits. A number of other substances have been found by
various experimenters to vary in toxicity for different species of
animals. Cantharadin, phenol, atropin, and strychnin may be mentioned
as illustrations.</p>

<p>Pharmacological studies on lower forms of life have also revealed
marked variations in the effect of some poisons. Observations made
by Danilewski<a href="#a18"><sup>18</sup></a> with hydrochinone indicate that solutions of 1 to
100 or 200 are toxic to Celentrates, causing paralysis in these organisms.
Echinoderms are killed within one or two hours in 1 to 1,000
or 2,000 solution, while in Vermes even weaker solutions cause
tetanus and finally paralysis. The experiments of Drzewina<a href="#a19"><sup>19</sup></a> with
potassium cyanid are also interesting in this connection. Teleosts
placed in 100 cc of sea water containing twentieth-normal potassium
cyanid showed signs of asphyxia and died in 10 to 20 minutes.
Actinia placed in a solution of sea water containing five times as
much potassium cyanid were active on the thirteenth day of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
experiment. Similar results were obtained with other marine
organisms.</p>

<p>From these data it is evident that the toxicity of a substance may
vary considerably in different forms of life. It has been shown also
by some investigations cited by Salant<a href="#a78"><sup>78</sup></a> that the action of drugs
may be modified by different conditions in the environment as well
as in the subject of the experiment. The recognition of the importance
of these factors in determining pharmacological action has contributed
much to the elucidation of the mechanism by which drugs
and other substances produce physiological effects in the body. Moreover,
such knowledge has often enhanced the therapeutic value of
pharmaco-dynamic agents and has frequently served to avert effects
of an undesirable character in man and domestic animals. The results
obtained in one species of animals under a particular condition do not
admit, therefore, of universal application. Furthermore, the nature
of the action of a drug can only be partly learned from the manifestation
of its acute effects. Equally important, therefore, especially in
studies on toxicity, are the changes produced in chronic intoxication.</p>

<p>That the acute effects of a substance can hardly be considered a
correct estimate of its toxicity is shown by the evidence obtained in
experiments on tolerance and cumulative action of drugs; for the
toxicity of a substance may diminish when the substance is given
steadily for a long time if the body acquires tolerance for it. Arsenic,
morphin, and cannabis indica may be cited as illustrations of drugs,
the toxicity of which decreases with repeated doses, while digitalis
and lead show a tendency to increased toxicity when similarly
administered. Moreover the acute and chronic effects are sometimes
qualitatively different. According to Igersheimer<a href="#a41"><sup>41</sup></a> the symptoms
in acute atoxyl intoxication are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
These symptoms are absent in chronic intoxication, in which trophic
disturbances of the skin and inflammation of the mucous membranes
were the effects produced. That the acute action of atoxyl differs
from the chronic effects was likewise shown by experiments on animals.
The studies of von Anrep<a href="#a5"><sup>5</sup></a> on chronic atropin intoxication
are of interest in this connection, as he found that after 10 to 15
injections of atropin there is no manifestation of symptoms such as
is observed in acute intoxication, while the effects on the circulation
are also less marked, the acceleration of the pulse being less than
after the same dose in a normal subject not accustomed to its use.
When the administration of atropin is continued for a longer time
its usual effects on the pulse disappear altogether; there is, on the
contrary a decreased frequency of the pulse. If atropin has been
administered for from two to three weeks, respiration is likewise
affected.</p>

<h2><a id="HISTORICAL_REVIEW_OF_THE_LITERATURE_ON_THE_TOXICITY_OF_CAFFEIN"></a>HISTORICAL REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE TOXICITY
OF CAFFEIN.</h2>


<p>Caffein was discovered in 1820 by Runge,<a href="#a77"><sup>77</sup></a> Pelletier,<a href="#a60"><sup>60</sup></a> and Robiquet<a href="#a75"><sup>75</sup></a>
and was first analyzed by Dumas and Pelletier,<a href="#a20"><sup>20</sup></a> but its
exact percentage composition was determined by Pfaff and Liebig,<a href="#a71"><sup>71</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a href="#a72"><sup>72</sup></a>
while to Herzog <a href="#a13"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a href="#a18"><sup>18</sup></a> belongs the credit of having established
that it is basic. Strecker<a href="#a82"><sup>82</sup></a> prepared caffein synthetically by heating
theobromin silver and methyl iodid in a closed tube for 24 hours.
Soon after its discovery in coffee Oudry<a href="#a67"><sup>67</sup></a> reported the presence of
a substance in tea which he called "thein." Its identity with caffein
was established 15 years later by Jobst<a href="#a43"><sup>43</sup></a> and also by Mulder.<a href="#a62"><sup>62</sup></a><sup>,</sup> <a href="#a63"><sup>63</sup></a>
According to Brill,<a href="#a13"><sup>13</sup></a> Mulder (1838) was also the first to perform
experiments with caffein on animals. After the administration of
one-half grain to a pregnant rabbit he observed loss of appetite and
kyphosis. The rabbit aborted but recovered from the effects of
caffein. It has since been made the subject of numerous investigations
which were carried out on a variety of animals. Observations
with caffein were also made on the human subject. About four
years after Mulder published his results, Lehmann<a href="#a51"><sup>51</sup></a> (1842) reported
experiments on a number of people who were given caffein. The
administration of from 2 to 10 grains of the alkaloid was followed by
headache, palpitation of the heart, increased frequency and irregularity
of the pulse, tinnitus aurium, photopsia, insomnia, and even
delirium. Similar experiments reported by Frerichs<a href="#a25"><sup>25</sup></a> (1846) indicate
that in doses of 25 grains it may induce severe symptoms about
15 minutes after its administration. He also observed circulatory as
well as nervous symptoms and vomiting.</p>

<p>According to Albers<a href="#a2"><sup>2</sup></a> (1852), 4.5 grains of caffein citrate injected
subcutaneously into the thigh of a rabbit was soon followed by diminished
motion and tremors of the operated thigh. Other symptoms
reported were spasms of the facial muscles, increased respiratory
movements, and mental confusion. Of interest in this connection
are the experiments of Cogswell<a href="#a17"><sup>17</sup></a> (1852) on frogs. He concluded that
in point of destructive action on the tissues, caffein is far superior
to morphin and may be compared to strychnin and coniin, its action
on the nervous system he believed to be principally confined to the
effect on the brain and spinal cord.</p>

<p>Lehmann<a href="#a52"><sup>52</sup></a> (1853) observed increased frequency of heart action
after the administration of 4 grains, which were given with a normal
diet to an adult man. When the dose was doubled the frequency of
the pulse was still more increased, heart action became stronger, and
tremors and confusion of thought with excitement of the imagination
made their appearance. There was also an increased desire to
micturate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Stuhlmann and Falck<a href="#a83"><sup>83</sup></a> (1857) were the first to make a study of
the toxicity of caffein on animals of different species. The administration
of 0.5 gram of caffein subcutaneously or per rectum in rabbits
induced tremors, tonic and clonic convulsions, paralysis, and increased
frequency of respiration at first followed by violent dyspn&oelig;a. On
autopsy he noticed congestion of the organs and in two of the three
rabbits experimented upon punctiform hemorrhages of the brain with
congestion of the meninges were found. In the other rabbit anemia
of the brain was observed. Experiments on cats were carried out
by subcutaneous, intravenous, and rectal injections. The symptoms
observed after the administration of 0.5 to 0.7 gram of caffein were
the same as in rabbits except that the cats developed diarrhea when
caffein was given and no anatomic lesions were found on autopsy.
The effect of caffein on dogs indicated that in subjects of medium
weight a dose of 0.5 gram given by mouth might produce restlessness
and increased frequency of respiration, while the injection of the
same amount intravenously into such animals may cause death.
Large, full-grown dogs, however, survived an intravenous injection
of 2 grams of caffein, showing symptoms of incoordination, salivation,
and frequent defecation. These investigators also made observations
on caffein, using pigeons and other birds; 0.5 to 0.1 gram introduced
into the stomach caused vomiting, diarrhea, tonic, but more frequently
clonic, convulsions, incoordination, tremors, paresis, and
paralysis.</p>

<p>In a few, but not in all of the birds, there was at first increased
frequency of respiration followed by dyspn&oelig;a and circulatory disturbances.
These amounts of caffein proved fatal in all of the experiments
on birds. Inflammation of the intestinal mucosa and congestion
of the meninges were the only changes found on autopsy.
Stuhlmann and Falck also studied the effects of caffein on fishes and
toads. Mitscherlich<a href="#a60"><sup>60</sup></a> (1858) fed 0.4 gram of caffein with bread to a
rabbit and noticed lowered temperature, fatigue, convulsions, first
increased then decreased frequency of respiration, and on autopsy
congestion of all the viscera. He also reported observations on two
frogs, one of which was given one-sixteenth of a grain of caffein in a
pill with bread. It was administered to the other frog in aqueous
solution, but the mode of administration was not published. The
symptoms observed were in the main the same as in rabbits. In
pigeons 0.125 gram introduced into the stomach caused severe vomiting,
muscular incoordination, tonic rigidity of the limbs, and retraction
of the head. Respiration was increased in frequency. Death
followed within 3 hours and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>From a series of experiments on frogs which Hoppe<a href="#a38"><sup>38</sup></a> carried out
(1858) by applying one-fourth of a grain of caffein to the muscles of
the back, he concluded that caffein causes paralysis of the nerves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
spinal cord, and brain, sensation being paralyzed before movement.
The injurious action of caffein proceeds, according to Hoppe, from
the spinal cord. This was based on experiments on two frogs, <i>Rana
esculenta</i>, in which the right leg was amputated, the nerve being left
intact, while the nerve of the other leg was ligated. At the end of
30 minutes paralysis was more marked on the right than on the left
side. In another frog of the same species he resected the femoral
nerve on the right side; about 1½ hours after the administration of
caffein convulsions were observed. The left leg was rigid, but the
right was relaxed.</p>

<p>Voit<a href="#a85"><sup>85</sup></a> (1860) ligated the vessels of the right lower extremity, cut
the nerves of the left leg, and introduced a few drops of caffein
solution into the stomach. Shortly afterwards tetanus of the right
leg occurred on touching the back of the animal; the left leg was
motionless. Later the entire body exhibited tetanic convulsions.
From this and similar experiments Voit concluded that caffein acts
first and principally on the central nervous system, and that caffein
is also poisonous to nerve and muscle fibers, as they die when a solution
of caffein is applied to them. The action of caffein, according to
Voit, is similar in great part to that of strychnin. The effect on the
blood vessels is particularly interesting, as Voit observed dilatation
of the vessels, due as he thought to muscular paralysis, and also transudation
and congestion of the capillaries.</p>

<p>Kurzak<a href="#a48"><sup>48</sup></a> (1860) made a study of the comparative toxicity of
caffein in frogs and rabbits and came to the conclusion that the lethal
dose for frogs is about one-seventh of that for rabbits. Caffein
citrate in the form of crystals was administered in both cases by
mouth. The doses given to frogs were 1 to 1.5 grains. He observed
convulsions and increased respiratory activity at first; after one hour
respiration diminished and voluntary muscular activity disappeared.
Even on the second day convulsions were sometimes noticed. Death
occurred at the end of the first or second day. Experiments on
only two rabbits were reported, 0.8 gram of caffein citrate causing
the death of one at the end of 13 hours. The symptoms noticed were
the same practically as in frogs, but it is interesting to observe that
ecchymosis of the mucous membranes of the stomach near the cardia
was the only lesion found on autopsy. Several experiments made
on different days on the other rabbit indicated that the toxic
dose exceeded 0.5 gram, while smaller doses caused but very mild
symptoms.</p>

<p>According to Gentilhomme<a href="#a27"><sup>27</sup></a> (1867), after caffein the reflexes are at
first diminished and then disappear altogether. Death is produced
by stiffness and immobility of all the muscles, particularly of the
muscles of respiration, thus causing asphyxia. He furthermore held
that caffein has no effect on cardiac or smooth muscle fiber, its action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
being specific on voluntary muscle fiber, contractions of which he
observed under the microscope, thus differing completely from strychnin,
which is a nerve poison.</p>

<p>These observations seemed to be confirmed by Pratt<a href="#a74"><sup>74</sup></a> (1868), who
reported that the isolated posterior extremities and muscle fibers of
the toad placed in a solution of caffein (1 grain to a wineglassful of
water) for three minutes were contracted, while controls placed in
distilled water were relaxed. This experiment is, of course, defective,
as normal salt solution should have been used in both cases. When
the muscular fibers previously immersed in caffein solution were
placed under the microscope violent contractions were observed.
The same author administered from 2 to 18 grains at a dose to five
healthy young men. After the administration of 12 grains he noticed
mental anguish, tremors of the hands and arms, and insomnia.
Doses under 5 grains had no marked effect except a diminution in the
frequency of the pulse and wakefulness.</p>

<p>About the same time Amory<a href="#a4"><sup>4</sup></a> (1868) published the results of his
studies on the toxicity of caffein in cats, dogs, rabbits, and pigeons.
In all cases very large doses were introduced directly into the stomach
by means of a temporary gastric fistula. Ten grains given in meat
to a dog caused restlessness, but no other symptoms. Doses of 30
grains and above were invariably fatal. Seventy-three grains given
to a cat caused death within 20 minutes.</p>

<p>From observations on frogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, and on one dog,
Leven<a href="#a53"><sup>53</sup></a> (1868) concluded that caffein which he gave in the form of
the citrate in doses of 10 mg to frogs, from 150 to 200 mg to guinea
pigs, and three to four times the latter amount to rabbits, stimulates
the central nervous system and the voluntary, cardiac, and smooth
muscles. He found that 0.9 gram caffein was fatal for a rabbit when
injected subcutaneously, while 1 gram of the citrate was not toxic
for a dog of medium size. Caffein applied directly to muscle fiber
causes tetanus and destroys muscular contractility, while a nerve
fiber similarly treated loses its irritability.</p>

<p>According to Johansen<a href="#a44"><sup>44</sup></a> (1869), caffein acts directly on the muscular
fiber. After the subcutaneous injection of 0.02 gram of caffein
into frogs, he observed contraction of the muscles at the site of injection,
then contraction of the anterior extremities, and finally the
posterior extremities become rigid and extended. Johansen observed
muscular rigidity after caffein, even after curara was injected, or after
ligating the vessels, or cutting the nerves which supply the muscles.
He also observed that large doses of caffein diminish muscular irritability.
When cardiac muscle was poisoned with caffein, microscopical
examination showed that the striations disappeared. Johansen also
states that reflexes disappear after caffein poisoning. He never
observed tetanus in frogs, but reported tonic and clonic convulsions as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
a result of caffein poisoning in mammals. Somewhat different effects
of caffein in frogs were observed by Buchheim and Eisenmenger<a href="#a14"><sup>14</sup></a>
(1870). After the injection of 2 per cent of the citrate the frogs soon
become inactive. He also observed muscular twitching of the
extremities, which gradually increased, with rigidity of the muscles
and opisthotonos, while respiration became slow and superficial,
finally stopping altogether.</p>

<p>Aubert<a href="#a6"><sup>6</sup></a> (1872) studied the toxicity of caffein in man and other
animals. After the ingestion of 0.36 gram, he observed dizziness,
but doses of 0.12 and 0.24 gram were without any apparent effect.
On the other hand, a dose of 0.5 gram of caffein was followed by
increased frequency of the pulse, which soon disappeared. After one
hour he noticed dizziness and trembling of the hands, which likewise
passed away soon. The injection of 0.16 gram of a 2 per cent solution
of caffein into the jugular vein of a rabbit weighing 1,090 grams
caused tetanus and death in two and one-half minutes, and 0.12 gram
injected into a rabbit weighing 980 grams caused death in one minute.
Much larger doses could be borne, however, when artificial respiration
was resorted to. A dog which was given 3 grams of caffein survived
when artificial respiration was performed. Aubert reports, on the
other hand, a similar experiment with 0.25 gram of caffein which
terminated fatally.</p>

<p>That caffein may give rise to different effects in various species of
animals was observed for the first time by Bennett.<a href="#a9"><sup>9</sup></a> He studied its
action on frogs, mice, rabbits, and cats, and attempted to determine
the minimum fatal dose in rabbits and cats. He also reported experiments
with thein. In his first communication on the subject he
states that the administration of thein to rabbits first increased and
then diminished the frequency of respiration, while the pulse was
decreased in frequency. Caffein, which he apparently thought was
different from thein, caused increased frequency of respiration, while
the pulse was markedly retarded after a preliminary acceleration.
He also noticed congestion of the ears, muscular incoordination,
tetanus, paralysis, diminished reflexes, and contraction of the pupils.
Bennett reported the minimum fatal dose of caffein for a rabbit weighing
3.25 pounds as being 5.25-5.5 grains. The symptoms in cats
after the administration of toxic doses of thein or of caffein were
great excitement, paralysis alternating with convulsions, and profuse
salivation. The minimum fatal dose for a cat weighing 5 pounds
was, according to Bennett, 6 grains of caffein and 5.5 grains of thein.
Only one experiment on a mouse is reported; the administration of
0.1 grain proved fatal. The symptoms were the same as those
observed in cats and rabbits after the administration of caffein. The
experiments on frogs indicate that the symptoms were about the
same as those previously described in the case of warm-blooded animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
except that the reflexes are almost completely lost after the subcutaneous
injection of doses of one-sixteenth to one-twelfth of a grain.
The latter dose was fatal for frogs. It would be of interest to know
the comparative toxicity of caffein to frogs and mammals, but unfortunately
the weights were not reported.</p>

<p>Schmiedeberg<a href="#a79"><sup>79</sup></a> (1874) noticed that the administration of 20 mg of
caffein to frogs weighing about 45 grams was followed, in <i>Rana esculenta</i>,
in about 25 minutes, by increased reflexes, 7 minutes later
by tetanus. Several attacks occurred, but tonic spasms were never
observed. On the contrary, when the same amount of caffein was
given to <i>Rana temporaria</i> weighing 45 grams he noticed a marked
diminution of the reflexes and tonic rigidity of the muscles after 23
minutes; the reflexes were greatly increased, however, about 24 hours
later. The frogs were under observation for three days, and although
symptoms were still present at the end of this time in the subjects of
both species tetanus was never observed in <i>Rana temporaria</i>.</p>

<p>Peretti's<a href="#a70"><sup>70</sup></a> (1875) studies on the effects of caffein were confined
chiefly to observations on dogs. He also made observations on a
few rabbits and reported an experiment on one cat to which he administered,
by subcutaneous injection, 0.18 gram of caffein per kilo and
noticed increased frequency in lachrymation and crying. The cat
was found dead the next day. The subcutaneous injection of a rabbit
in which artificial respiration was instituted with 0.36 gram of caffein
per kilo proved fatal soon after the injection without any manifestation
of symptoms. Small doses of caffein, 0.1 gram, given to a rabbit
weighing 3,670 grams, failed to produce any visible effects. Doses
under 0.1 gram per kilo likewise failed to induce any symptoms in
dogs. When 0.1 gram of caffein per kilo was given by mouth or subcutaneously
it was followed by restlessness, salivation, rigidity of
hind legs, and vomiting. In both instances the dogs recovered. The
symptoms were more severe when the dose was increased to 0.185
gram per kilo, but even in this case the dog recovered. A dose of 0.2
gram per kilo, however, proved fatal.</p>

<p>Henneguy<a href="#a36"><sup>36</sup></a> (1875) experimented on three frogs to which he gave
0.01 gram of caffein citrate subcutaneously. He observed mild stimulation
of the nervous system and of the muscles, as well as increased
cardiac activity. Later, voluntary movement and respiration disappeared
and sensations diminished, but convulsions of the extremities
appeared. Cardiac activity was then diminished, the heart being
finally arrested in systole. Since the motor nerves retained their irritability
even after the reflexes disappeared, he concluded that the
loss of motion was due to the action of caffein on the nerve centers.</p>

<p>Binz<a href="#a11"><sup>11</sup></a> (1878) reported experiments on dogs and also made some
observations on man with caffein. The subcutaneous injections of
0.2 gram caffein may prove fatal to dogs, although some survive such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
a dose. The toxic dose in man varies from 0.5 to 1.5 grams. Disturbance
of the circulation, such as palpitation of the heart and fullness
of pulse, restlessness, and diarrhea were the symptoms he
observed.</p>

<p>Extensive investigations on the action of caffein were carried out
by Leblond<a href="#a50"><sup>50</sup></a> (1883), who studied its effect on the circulation in man
and lower animals, and its toxicity in the lower animals alone. Five
to twenty centigrams of caffein and 0.06 to 0.25 gram of salicylate of
soda were dissolved and injected into the muscles of the thigh of
young guinea pigs weighing a little over 300 grams. In the three
experiments reported the death of the animals occurred after 23 minutes,
40 minutes, and 1 hour and 20 minutes. Symptoms appeared
in from 10 to 15 minutes after the injection of caffein. Incoordination
of movements, convulsions, both tonic and clonic, opisthotonos,
tremors, increased frequency of respiration, ataxia, paralysis were
the symptoms observed. It is worthy of note that the appearance
of paresis preceded the convulsions. Diminished sensation was
reported in one pig, but no sensory disturbances nor reflexes had been
observed in the other. Two rabbits, one of which received 0.5 and
the other about 0.3 gram of caffein per kilo with equal parts of salicylate
of soda, were injected subcutaneously into the thigh. Diminished
sensation, paresis of the posterior extremities, hyperexcitability,
convulsions, opisthotonos, dilation of the veins of the ear were
observed. Death followed in 1 hour and 23 minutes in one rabbit
and in 3 hours and 7 minutes in the other.</p>

<p>Filehne<a href="#a22"><sup>22</sup></a> (1886) experimented with caffein on <i>Rana esculenta</i> and
<i>Rana temporaria</i>. The subcutaneous injection of 7 mg of caffein into
<i>Rana esculenta</i> caused tetanus, while 50 mg given by mouth caused
tonic spasms. He further stated that the difference between <i>Rana
esculenta</i> and <i>Rana temporaria</i> as regards the reaction to caffein was
one of degree only.</p>

<p>Amat<a href="#a3"><sup>3</sup></a> (1889) reported experiments on three guinea pigs, in which
0.4 to 0.5 gram per kilo injected subcutaneously proved fatal within
38 and 44 minutes. One guinea pig which received 0.1 gram of
caffein per kilo survived. The symptoms observed in the two fatal
cases were general muscular rigidity and convulsions.</p>

<p>Parisot<a href="#a68"><sup>68</sup></a> (1890) made a study of the toxicity of caffein on different
species of animals. Unlike most of his predecessors, however, he
reported, at least in some cases, the weight of the animals on which he
worked. After the subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of
from 5 to 20 mg of caffein into <i>Rana temporaria</i> weighing from 14 to 16
grams, he noticed increased irritability at first; later, a loss of reflexes,
inability to use the muscles, complete muscular rigidity resembling
rigor mortis, and also cessation of heart action. The effect of caffein
produced in the green frog was analogous to that observed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
strychnin poisoning. Parisot found, however, that muscular rigidity
developed, although very gradually, also in the green frog, but it set
in much later than in frogs of the other species and without superseding
the clonic convulsions. According to Parisot, the muscular
rigidity after caffein persists after the destruction of the brain and
spinal cord, thus showing that it is not of nervous origin. He further
emphasized the difference in the behavior of these two species of frogs
toward caffein by stating that he never observed tetanic convulsions
in the red frog. His experiments also indicate that the green frog is
more resistant to caffein than <i>Rana temporaria</i>, as the same doses
which are fatal for the latter were only toxic for <i>Rana esculenta</i>.
The number of experiments, however, is too few to justify a positive
conclusion on this point. Parisot also made some experiments on
turtles. The results he obtained show that caffein is at least as toxic
for these animals as for the frogs he experimented upon, 0.33 gram
per kilo (carapace not included in weight) having proved fatal within
24 hours. Two experiments on one pigeon were also reported by the
same observer; two doses of 0.06 gram per kilo given at an interval
of four hours caused mental depression and muscular rigidity, but the
pigeon survived.</p>

<p>Experiments with caffein on the human subject made by Parisot
showed that man is far more susceptible to this substance than the
other animals he investigated. After the ingestion of 0.3 gram of
caffein symptoms of intoxication pointing to cerebral disturbance
appeared, which became more marked when the size of the doses was
increased.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the nature of the action of caffein, whether it
is a nerve or a muscle poison, formed the subject of several investigations.
Binz<a href="#a11"><sup>11</sup></a> (1890) brought forward additional evidence in support
of the view that caffein acts primarily on the ganglion cells, and not on
the muscle directly. This he has shown by injecting 0.5 gram into
each of two rabbits after cutting the sciatic nerve on one side; in one
case he also resected the obdurator and crural nerves on the same side.
Clonic spasms developed in both subjects soon after caffein was given,
but in each rabbit the side operated upon remained paralyzed.
Baldi<a href="#a8"><sup>8</sup></a> (1891) studied the action of caffein on <i>Rana esculenta</i>. After
injecting from 4 to 20 mg tetanus, such as observed in strychnin
poisoning, was noticed. Fröhner<a href="#a26"><sup>26</sup></a> (1892) made observations on the
comparative toxicity of caffein in domesticated animals. After the
administration of 5 grams of caffein sodium salicylate by mouth to a
dog weighing 10 kilos, he noticed salivation, restlessness, vomiting,
and convulsions as in strychnin poisoning. Death occurred three
hours after the drug was given. On autopsy he noticed mild inflammation
of the mucous membranes of the stomach and intestines and
edema of the lungs; the heart was in diastole. A dose of 2 grams of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
caffein sodium salicylate given to the same animal subcutaneously two
days previously provoked only very slight symptoms. The subcutaneous
injection of 10 grams of the same preparation into a pig
weighing 30 kilos caused death in two and a half hours, with the production
of symptoms of disturbance of the nervous system and of
gastrointestinal irritation. The same dose per kilo of body weight
given to a goat likewise caused death in two and a half hours after its
administration. Examination on autopsy revealed inflammation of
the gastrointestinal tract. Similar lesions were found in a horse
killed by 100 grams of caffein, in which he also noticed hemorrhage
of the mucosa in the fundus of the stomach.</p>

<p>Gourewitch<a href="#a28"><sup>28</sup></a> (1907) conducted experiments with caffein on
rabbits, pigeons, and white rats. It appears from his protocol that
single doses of about 0.2 to 0.25 gram caffein per kilo given subcutaneously
proved to be fatal. He states, however, that the resistance
to caffein was markedly diminished, when its administration was
repeated daily, for much smaller amounts sufficed to cause death in
these animals. A dose of 120 mg of caffein per kilo proved fatal after
the third injection. When the dose was increased to 170 mg per kilo,
the animal succumbed to the effects of caffein after the second injection.
His experiments on the other animals do not indicate the
degree of resistance to caffein, since the weights for some were not
given while for the others no attempt was made to determine the
minimum toxic or fatal dose.</p>

<p>Maurel<a href="#a55"><sup>55</sup></a> (1907) studied the influence of different methods of
administration on the toxicity of caffein on frogs and rabbits. He
determined the minimum toxic and lethal doses of caffein hydrobromid
which he employed in 1 to 2 per cent solutions. He concluded
from his experiments that the toxicity of caffein when given by
mouth is twice as great for the frog as for the rabbit.</p>

<p>More recently Hale<a href="#a33"><sup>33</sup></a> carried out a number of experiments on guinea
pigs in which he determined the toxicity of caffein given in the form
of the citrate and made into a pill with mucilage of acacia and arrow-root
starch. After the pill was dried it was fed to the animal, due
precaution being taken that none of it was lost during feeding.
From experiments on guinea pigs which received doses of 0.3 to 0.6
gram caffein citrate, the following data have been reported: Three
decigrams per kilo given to one pig was not fatal. Of three pigs
which received 0.4 per kilo, one died and two survived. Exactly
the same results were obtained in three others which received 0.5 per
kilo. Two guinea pigs, which received 0.55 and 0.6 per kilo each,
died after 15 and 7 hours, respectively, while another animal survived
a dose of 0.45 per kilo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>This review of the literature on the toxicity of caffein, although
bearing evidence of considerable investigation and extending over
three-quarters of a century, is largely qualitative in character. It
appears from the experiments that the main object of the investigations
was to ascertain the nature of the action of caffein, whether it
is a muscle or a nerve poison. The comparative toxicity in different
species of animals by the accurate determination of the toxic and
fatal doses received but little attention. To fill the gap in our
knowledge of the toxic effects of caffein, the present investigation
was undertaken. This, it will be seen, proved to be a most laborious
task, because in the large number of experiments careful observations
showed that individuals of the same species varied considerably in
their reaction to the drug. Numerous other factors, as will be shown,
were also found to play an important part in the determination of the
toxicity of caffein.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="ACUTE_CAFFEIN_INTOXICATION" id="ACUTE_CAFFEIN_INTOXICATION">ACUTE CAFFEIN INTOXICATION.</a></h2>


<p>The object of these experiments was to determine the resistance
to caffein in various species of animals and by various methods of
administration. Caffein was therefore given by mouth and injected
subcutaneously into the peritoneal cavity, into the muscles, and intravenously.
As far as could be judged by appearance, healthy animals
were selected for the subjects of the experiments, but as it is
impossible to diagnose with any degree of accuracy the condition of
the animal while it is alive, post mortem examinations were resorted
to in many cases in which the issue of the experiment was fatal.
Since the age of the animal may modify toxicity full grown, as well
as young, animals were employed for these experiments; diet, race,
and season also play an important part in determining the toxicity
of a drug and these factors were also taken into account in the present
investigation.</p>


<h3><a id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_RABBITS"></a>EXPERIMENTS ON RABBITS.</h3>

<p>Animals of different varieties were used and were given caffein by all of the methods
indicated in the preceding paragraph. Some of the rabbits employed in these experiments
received oats, others received a diet exclusively of carrots for several days or weeks
previous to the administration of caffein. The experiments were conducted at all seasons
of the year.</p>


<h4><a id="SUBCUTANEOUS_INJECTION"></a>SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION.</h4>

<p>From a study of the literature on the toxicity of caffein it seemed that about 150 mg
per kilo is probably the lethal dose for the rabbit when the drug is injected subcutaneously.
Preliminary observations were therefore carried out with such a dose, but
it was found, on the contrary, that this amount per kilo was hardly sufficient to induce
symptoms in the great majority of cases.</p>

<p>October 14: 16 cc 2 per cent caffein (167 mg per kilo) injected subcutaneously;
reflexes increased and tremors present.</p>

<p>October 15: Condition of rabbit good.</p>

<p>A study of this series shows that about 150 mg of caffein per kilo caused increased
reflexes within one to two hours after injection. When the dose was increased, as
in rabbits 194 and 191, the symptoms were more pronounced; 150 mg per kilo may
be regarded as the minimum dose which produces symptoms of nervous irritability
when caffein is injected subcutaneously. Experiments with larger doses were therefore
carried out in order to determine the minimum fatal dose.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>Approximately 0.2 gram of caffein per kilo was employed in these experiments.
Diet and race as possible factors which may influence the toxicity of caffein were
made the subject of study in these experiments which were divided into two groups
as shown in the table, <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 95. Gray and white male. Weight, 1,478 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 27: 11.30 a. m., 15 cc 2 per cent caffein (210 mg per kilo) injected subcutaneously;
2.20 p. m., no symptoms, tremors observed when handled, but not
marked, reflexes slightly increased, no muscular rigidity nor any other symptoms;
2.45 p. m., rabbit suddenly became very restless, jumped off the table, and had
convulsions; 3.45 p. m., rabbit died, rigor mortis set in almost immediately after
death.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 96. Gray and white male. Weight, 1,585 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 27: 16 cc 2 per cent caffein (200 mg per kilo) injected subcutaneously
at 3.40 p. m.; increased reflexes observed about one hour after caffein was injected,
but no other symptoms.</p>

observed, but no other symptoms; 4.15 p. m., rabbit had tremors, was handled but

<p><i>Rabbit 195. White female. Weight, 1,300 grams. Diet, carrots, since October 7.</i></p>

<p>October 14: 13 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.2 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously at
11.15 a. m.; 2.25 p. m., rabbit had convulsions and died. <i>Note</i>: Ulceration of
rectum was noticed.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 208. Gray. Weight, 1,068 grams. Diet, carrots, October 7-15, inclusive.</i></p>

<p>October 15: 10 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously at 11 a. m.; 1 p. m.,
increased reflexes and tremors observed; 3.45 p. m., tremors were marked when
rabbit was handled.</p>

<p>October 16: Rabbit found dead. <i>Note</i>: Looked poorly nourished.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 247. Belgian hare, female. Weight, 1,295 grams. Diet, oats last 10 days before
experiment.</i></p>

<p>November 10: 11 a. m., urine obtained from the bladder was acid to litmus and
did not contain sugar or albumen, 13 cc 2 per cent caffein was injected subcutaneously;
1.30 p. m., 15 cc urine obtained was markedly alkaline to litmus and reduced Fehling's
solution; 2.30 p. m., reduction of urine considerable, marked tremors observed
but no tetanus.</p>

<p>November 11: 10.30 a. m., 95 cc urine collected gave moderate reduction of Fehling's
solution, no symptoms, condition of rabbit seemed to be good.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 248. Belgian hare, female. Weight, 1,305 grams. Diet, oats the last 10 days
before the experiment.</i></p>

<p>November 10: 11 a. m., urine markedly acid to litmus, no albumen, no sugar;
13 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously; 1.30 p. m., urine was slightly alkaline
to litmus, no reduction of Fehling's solution; 2 p. m., reflexes increased; 2.30
p. m., 2 cc urine obtained from bladder, sugar abundant; 4.45 p. m., reflexes increased
as before, but no tetanus.</p>

<p>November 11: 10.30 a. m., urine collected showed slight reduction of Fehling's
solution; otherwise condition of rabbit was good; rabbit did not show any effects
of caffein.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 337. Belgian hare. Weight, 1,040 grams. Diet, carrots, March 31 to April 6,
inclusive.</i></p>

<p>April 6: 3 p. m., 11 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously in the back
(0.211 per kilo); 4.30 p. m., reflexes much exaggerated.</p>

<p>April 7: 8.15 a. m.; condition good, no symptoms.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 336. Belgian hare. Weight, 1,040 grams. Diet, carrots, March 31 to April 6,
inclusive.</i></p>

<p>April 6: 3 p. m., 11 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously into tissues of
the back.</p>

<p>April 7: 8.15 a. m., no symptoms, condition good.</p>

<p>Although symptoms appeared in rabbits of Group I (see table, <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>) about the
same time after the administration of caffein as in the rabbits of the preceding series
all of them terminated fatally 2¼ hours to 24 hours after its administration. Two
of these rabbits (Nos. 195 and 208) were fed carrots for several days before the injection
of caffein, the others were fed oats. Since symptoms and death appeared in
these two rabbits about the same time as in the rest of this group it may be concluded
that caffein is not less toxic when carrots are fed than when oats form the exclusive
diet. But since rabbit No. 208 was poorly nourished and ulceration of the rectum
was observed in No. 195 it is quite possible that caffein might be less toxic in
normal rabbits on this diet. This was tested in rabbits Nos. 336 and 337, both of
which seemed to be free from abnormality and were well nourished. Since these
rabbits survived and manifested mild symptoms only of intoxication it would seem
that a carrot diet decreases the toxicity of caffein.</p>

<p>It was suggested, however, that another factor might be the cause of the greater
resistance to caffein in these two rabbits, namely, race. This was tested in rabbits 247
and 248, both Belgian hares. Since the toxicity of caffein in these two rabbits was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
same as in Nos. 336 and 337, diet as a factor in acute caffein intoxication may be disregarded.
The greater resistance to caffein of these four rabbits is in all probability
due, therefore, to a difference of race. This suggestion gained additional support
from the experiments of the next series.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series C.</span></p>

<p>The object of these experiments was to determine the minimum fatal dose for the
gray rabbit and to obtain additional evidence as to the toxicity of caffein in the several
varieties of rabbits. Eight experiments were performed, in which from 236 to 252 mg
per kilo were given. The white rabbits, three in number, received 250, 242, and 238
mg per kilo. All the others (which were Belgian hares) received from 236 to 252 mg
per kilo. Two of the white rabbits were fed carrots for one week preceding the injection
of caffein. The other was fed oats. Three of the Belgian hares were on a diet
of oats, two were fed carrots the week before the experiment with caffein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>



<p><i>Rabbit 834. Belgian hare, female. Weight, 1,270 grams. Diet, carrots, March 31 to
April 7.</i></p>

<p>April 7: 9.30 a. m., 15 cc 2 per cent caffein (240 mg per kilo) injected subcutaneously
in the back; 10.30 a. m., reflexes much increased, rabbit extremely sensitive.</p>

<p>April 8: 9 a. m., condition good, no symptoms.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 233. White, male. Weight, 1,675 grams. Diet, carrots, November 2 to 9.</i></p>

<p>November 9: 10.50 a. m., 20 cc 2 per cent caffein (238 mg per kilo) injected subcutaneously,
no symptoms observed until 5 p. m., when increased reflexes and hyperæsthesia
were noticed, but no tetanus.</p>

<p>November 10: 9 a. m., paralysis of posterior extremities; died at 1 p. m.</p>

<p>Analysis of the results obtained in the experiments of this series and inspection of
Table I, <a href="#Page_25">page 25</a>, show that all four of the rabbits which survived doses of 236 to 252 mg
of caffein per kilo were Belgian hares. Of the four which died one only was a Belgian
hare. The other three were white rabbits. Two of these were fed oats; the other two
received carrots during seven days preceding the administration of caffein. This diet
does not seem to be a factor, therefore, in the toxicity of caffein. Moreover, it may
be observed that rabbit No. 122, which was fed oats, died after receiving 250 mg per
kilo, while rabbit No. 250 received the same diet and survived the same dose of caffein
per kilo.</p>

<p>Experiments 234 and 334 offer another illustration that the toxicity of caffein is not
dependent upon diet, since both rabbits were fed carrots, but the same dose of caffein
caused only symptoms in one while it proved fatal to the other. It is evident, therefore,
that the difference in resistance to caffein shown in these experiments is in all
probability due to race, the Belgian hare being more resistant to caffein than rabbits
of other varieties. Rabbit No. 335 seems to be an exception, but the post-mortem
examination showed the presence of coccidiosis of the liver. As will be shown later,
wherever this condition prevailed even smaller doses of caffein proved fatal.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series D.</span></p>

<p>To obtain additional evidence regarding the resistance of the various races of rabbits
to caffein and to ascertain the smallest dose which is surely fatal to the gray rabbit or
Belgian hare was the object of this series of experiments. The diet in all cases consisted
of oats, which was given ad libitum excepting to rabbit No. 235, which received
carrots for one week previous to the injection of caffein. The doses administered
ranged from 267 to 300 mg per kilo and were administered to different varieties of adult
rabbits.</p>

engorged and friable; gall cyst well filled; stomach exhibited catarrhal gastritis; injection
of mesenteries and intestines; kidney showed marked cortical congestion.</p>

<p>The results of the experiments of this series likewise indicate that the Belgian
hare is more resistant to caffein than the rabbits of other varieties. Thus, of the four
gray rabbits (Nos. 235, 316, 395, and 396), which received 267 to 283 mg of caffein per
kilo, two died and two lived,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> one of which, 396, showed the presence of coccidiosis
of the liver. On the other hand it will be observed that the black and white rabbits
which received from 270 to 275 mg of caffein per kilo all died from the effects of the
drug; one within 1 hour and 25 minutes and another within 50 hours after the administration
of the caffein, while No. 340 died in the night. Furthermore it will be noted
that of the last three rabbits of this series, which were Belgian hares and received
290, 293, and 300 mg of caffein, two died six hours after the injection, while the other,
No. 397, lived three days. The minimum fatal dose of caffein for Belgian hares is,
therefore, about 290 to 300 mg per kilo when injected subcutaneously, which is about
50 per cent greater than for rabbits of other varieties.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series E.</span></p>

<p>It was shown in series A that 0.15 caffein per kilo caused symptoms of intoxication.
Before concluding, however, that this is the smallest dose which causes symptoms of
poisoning, a number of experiments were performed with smaller doses. It was
found that in the great majority of cases 0.1 caffein per kilo may cause diuresis,
but no nervous or muscular symptoms. In some rabbits, however, even such a dose
proved fatal. Post-mortem examinations in these cases showed the presence of
coccidiosis of the liver, and it will be recalled that similar observations were made
before. It is quite possible, therefore, that coccidiosis of the liver is an important
factor in decreasing the resistance to caffein. Experiment 551 (p. 25) shows that
other conditions may likewise increase the toxicity of caffein.</p>

<h4><a id="ADMINISTRATION_BY_MOUTH"></a>ADMINISTRATION BY MOUTH.</h4>

<p>These experiments were carried out on two varieties of rabbits, the white and the
gray. The diet consisted chiefly of oats, but in a few cases carrots formed the exclusive
diet. Food and water were given ad libitum. A 2 per cent solution of caffein was
administered through a stomach tube. Since the resistance to most drugs is commonly
supposed to be greater when given by mouth than when administered by any
other path, doses of 175 to 200 mg per kilo were fed in a series of preliminary experiments,
all of which were performed on gray rabbits weighing from 865 to 1,135 grams,
and which were fed carrots for several days previous to the experiment. Three of the
rabbits survived, two without showing any symptoms; in the other case paralysis of
the posterior extremities was observed five hours after he received caffein and he was
found dead the next morning. Unfortunately no autopsy was performed. The low
resistance to caffein of this animal was probably due to some abnormal condition which
developed about the time of the experiment, since this rabbit received 325 mg of
caffein per kilo two weeks previously and increased reflexes only were observed as a
result of this treatment. Hence 200 mg of caffein per kilo can not be considered the
toxic dose when fed by mouth. In the following experiments larger doses were
therefore given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>A study of these experiments shows also considerable variation in the toxicity of
caffein when given by mouth. In some cases a dose of 300 mg per kilo, and even less,
caused death, as in rabbits 423 and 424. In other rabbits, however, approximately the
same doses of caffein produced increased reflexes only. The same symptoms were produced
in Nos. 248 and 249 after the administration of 325-330 mg of caffein per kilo,
while another rabbit (No. 239) survived a dose of 363 mg per kilo. That this is exceptional,
however, appears from the result of the following experiments on rabbits
Nos. 419, 420, and 421, all of which died after receiving 350 mg of caffein per kilo, and
rabbits 267 and 268, to which doses of 363 and 342 mg, respectively, per kilo proved
fatal. It will be observed further that the gray rabbits are more resistant to caffein
than the white animals, as 350 mg per kilo was the smallest fatal dose for rabbits 419,
420, and 421, all of which were gray rabbits, while a dose of 290 mg per kilo was fatal
for some of the white rabbits. Again, it will be noticed that of the two gray rabbits,
Nos. 254 and 239, which received the largest doses in these experiments, namely, 369
and 363 mg, respectively, one survived. The largest doses given to the white rabbits
were 363 and 342 mg caffein per kilo. Both of these died from the effects of the drug.
It may be concluded, therefore, that the minimum toxic dose for the gray rabbit is
about 325 mg of caffein per kilo, and the minimum fatal dose is at least 350 mg per kilo.
It is to be remarked in this connection that post-mortem examination showed extensive
coccidiosis in rabbit 420 and fatty liver in No. 421, while the macroscopical
examination of the organs of Nos. 424 and 423 failed to show the presence of such
abnormalities. Since, as was observed in the section on subcutaneous injection and
elsewhere in this investigation, pathological changes are apt to decrease the resistance
to caffein, it is quite possible that 350 mg per kilo is not the minimum fatal dose for
the normal rabbit. Indeed, the experiment on rabbit 239 lends support to this
view, thus furnishing additional evidence of difference in the resistance to caffein
in the two varieties of rabbits.</p>

<h4><a id="INJECTION_INTO_THE_PERITONEAL_CAVITY"></a>INJECTION INTO THE PERITONEAL CAVITY.</h4>

<p>In a number of experiments caffein was introduced into the peritoneal cavity.
Rabbits of different varieties receiving a diet of oats or carrots were employed for this
purpose; food and water were given ad libitum. The minimum doses required to
induce symptoms or cause death in these animals were determined; tests with caffein
were also made on young rabbits in order to study the influence of age on the resistance
to this substance. The results are shown in the following experiments:</p>

<p>March 16: Condition good.</p>

<p>March 17: Condition good, recovery apparently complete.</p>

<p>Since the experiments of Series A, which were intended as preliminary tests, have
shown that 0.3 gram of caffein per kilo when introduced into the peritoneal cavity is
rapidly absorbed and is fatal, much smaller doses were employed in subsequent
trials with the drug. This is shown in series B, which may be divided into two
groups. Group I, consisting of rabbits 69, 70, 92, 93, and 309, which received 0.2
gram of caffein per kilo, and Group II, Nos. 307 and 308, into which 0.15 gram of
caffein per kilo was injected. Three rabbits of Group I (Nos. 92, 93, 309) died from
the effects of caffein; rabbit 309 twenty minutes after injection, and rabbits Nos. 92
and 93, twenty hours and two and one-half hours, respectively, after the administration
of caffein. In both of these rabbits symptoms appeared within five minutes after the
injections were made. Rabbits 69 and 70, it will be noticed, survived the same
amount of caffein in proportion to body weight as was given to the other members of
this group. Increased peristalsis and the distribution of the dose may account for the
greater resistance of rabbit No. 69. The case of rabbit No. 70 is evidently one of exceptional
resistance to caffein, since both the rabbits of Group II died from the effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of a much smaller dose, namely, 0.15 gram of caffein per kilo. Moreover, macroscopical
examination at the autopsy of Nos. 307 and 308 failed to show any lesions which might
tend to lessen the resistance to caffein.</p>

<p>That a dose of 0.15 gram per kilo is therefore in all probability the minimum fatal
dose for the rabbit when injected into the peritoneal cavity appears from the results
of the experiments in series C, in which smaller doses, 0.125 gram of caffein per kilo
caused mild symptoms only, while 0.1 gram per kilo rarely induced any symptoms.
It may be remarked that the rabbits of series C were fed carrots while rabbits Nos. 307
and 308 received oats. Their resistance to caffein may be different, but, as was
pointed out in the earlier part of this investigation, diet does not seem to influence the
toxicity of the single dose of caffein. Doses of 150 and of 100 to 125 mg per kilo, when
injected into the peritoneal cavity, may be considered, respectively, as the minimum
fatal and minimum toxic doses for the gray rabbit. Analysis of the experiments in
series D shows much greater resistance to caffein than in the other rabbits which
received it intraperitoneally. Thus, after the administration of 0.2 gram per kilo to
each of five rabbits, no effect was observed in two cases (Nos. 310, 311), while in two
others (Nos. 74, 75) symptoms developed, but they survived. Only one rabbit, No.
312, died from the effects of this dose; the autopsy showed the presence of degeneration
of the liver and petechial hemorrhages on the cortex of the kidneys in the case of
No. 310, which was probably the cause of death rather than the caffein.</p>

<p>Two decigrams of caffein can not be considered, therefore, the fatal dose for rabbits.
This is further corroborated by the results obtained in experiments with larger doses.
Rabbit 78, which received 257 mg per kilo, failed to show any symptoms. The same
amount in proportion to body weight in No. 323 caused mild symptoms only, while
the rapid death of rabbit No. 317 after the same dose of caffein may be explained by the
lesion found at autopsy, thus affording additional evidence that disease may decrease
the resistance to caffein. It will be observed that all the members of this series were
young rabbits and, as will be shown later, young animals of other species are likewise
more resistant to caffein than adult animals. Similar results were obtained by von
Anrep, who observed that atropin is less toxic in young than in full-grown animals.</p>

<p>Observations were also made on the diuretic effect of caffein when injected into the
peritoneal cavity. The results shown in the following table indicates the stimulating
effect on renal secretion whether the diet consisted of oats or of carrots. The urine of
some rabbits contained moderate amounts of sugar after from 0.2 to 0.15 gram of caffein
per kilo was given; albumen was observed in one case, but in none of the others. In
rabbit No. 311 albumin was found before the injection of caffein, but none in the urine
which was collected three hours after caffein was injected.</p>

<p>The data presented in these experiments show that the toxicity of caffein when
injected into the muscles of the lumbar regions is the same as when injected into the
gluteal muscles. The rabbits of series A received approximately 0.2 gram caffein per
kilo and two died as a result of this treatment. The other two survived but symptoms
of caffein intoxication were observed.</p>

<p>In series B smaller doses proved fatal, from which it would appear that caffein is
more toxic when injected into the lumbar muscles. Further observations, however,
failed to corroborate the results obtained in this series. Thus, in series C, 130 to 150<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
mg of caffein per kilo injected into the lumbar muscles produced mild symptoms only.
Experiments with larger doses showed that 0.180 gram caffein per kilo may cause
death. It will be noticed, on the other hand, that rabbit No. 455 survived a dose of
0.2 gram per kilo. New experiments were therefore carried out in which the same
amounts of caffein in proportion to the weight of the animals were injected into the
lumbar muscles as into the gluteal muscles. As shown in the experiments of series D,
one rabbit (No. 581) died shortly after caffein was injected into the lumbar muscles;
two recovered. Two of the three which received injections into the gluteal muscles
were found dead the next day; one recovered. Post-mortem examination failed to
indicate the presence of any abnormalities. The rate of absorption of caffein from
the gluteal and from the lumbar muscles seems to be, therefore, the same, or not to
differ very much. The observations of Auer and Meltzer<a href="#a7"><sup>7</sup></a> are of interest in this connection.
According to their investigations adrenalin is more rapidly absorbed from
the lumbar than from the gluteal muscles. This is in all probability due to the greater
delicacy of the test they employed (since they judged the rate of absorption by the
effect of adrenalin on blood pressure) as well as to the much greater activity of the
substance.</p>

<p>Examination of Table 4 shows that 14 rabbits received from 180 to 210 mg caffein
per kilo. The appearance of symptoms in these rabbits varied considerably. In
some increased reflexes could be noticed in 10 to 15 minutes after the injection of
caffein; in others it was delayed 2 or 3 hours. It might be added that the onset of
symptoms occurred in many cases very soon after the administration of the drug&mdash;on
an average about 10 to 30 minutes after the drug was injected. After smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
doses were administered by injection into the lumbar muscles the appearance of
symptoms was delayed several hours in some cases. The duration of life in these 14
rabbits varied considerably. Eight of them died within 1 to 20 hours; six survived.
About 0.2 gram caffein per kilo may be regarded as the minimum fatal dose, while
the minimum toxic dose is somewhere between 130 and 150 mg per kilo.</p>


<h4><a id="INTRAVENOUS_INJECTION"></a>INTRAVENOUS INJECTION.</h4>

<p>These experiments were carried out on well-fed, full-grown gray rabbits. The diet
for several days preceding the experiments consisted of oats or carrots, which were given
ad libitum. The injections were made into the ear veins from a burette or by means
of a syringe, the temperature of the caffein solution being about 40° C. Attention
was also directed to the effect of the rate of injection and of the concentration on the
toxicity. The minimum toxic as well as lethal doses were determined as shown in
the following experiments.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series A.</span></p>

2.30 p. m., found dead. Total amount injected in 15 minutes, 8.5 cc, or 0.126
gram per kilo.</p>

<p>It will be observed in the preceding experiments that symptoms of severe intoxication
were present in all of the six rabbits, but only two of these (Nos. 294 and 556)
died from the effects of caffein. Of those which survived, three received doses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
100 to 114 mg caffein per kilo, and another (No. 292) received 141 mg of caffein per
kilo. The death of rabbits Nos. 294 and 556 may be regarded therefore as a case of
exceptionally low resistance to caffein.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>Doses of 160 to 200 mg caffein per kilo were employed in these experiments. The
rate of injection was 1 cc per minute, with the exception of Experiment 254, in
which 10.8 cc 2 per cent caffein were introduced in 17 minutes and 25 seconds.</p>

<p>In the eight experiments comprising series B rabbits Nos. 567, 254, 279, and 255,
which may be designated as Group II, received doses of 162, 160, 166, and 158 mg,
respectively. Nos. 562, 561, 560, and 559, which may be designated as Group I,
received about 200 mg caffein per kilo. In Group II, which received the smaller
doses, one (No. 254) survived. This may be regarded as exceptional, since, as was
shown in the experiments of the preceding series, even smaller doses may be fatal.
About 160 mg per kilo is, therefore, the smallest surely fatal dose. This might be
regarded as a contradiction of the results obtained for rabbit No. 559, but it will be
noticed that in this case diuresis was very marked. The results of experiments
Nos. 294 and 255 are of interest in this connection, since they indicate that a moderate
difference in the rate of injection is without any effect on the toxicity of caffein.
The greater resistance to caffein of rabbit No. 559 is in all probability due, therefore,
to increased diuresis.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series C.</span></p>

<p>In these experiments the minimum toxic dose was determined. The conditions
were the same as in the experiments of the other series.</p>



<p>
<i>Rabbit 293. Belgian hare, female. Weight, 1,610 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 18: 3.40 to 3.43 p. m., 4 cc 2 per cent warm caffein solution injected into
ear vein, convulsions when 3 cc were injected, repeated attacks; 4 p. m., raised itself
on legs, but fell over immediately and lay stretched on abdomen.</p>

<p>February 19: 9 a. m., rabbit looked normal, apparently recovered.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 227. White male. Weight, 2,320 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 26: 3.29¼ to 3.37½ p. m., injected into ear from burette 6.7 cc 2 per cent
caffein, no symptoms; experiment discontinued; survived.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 563. Gray female. Weight, 1,650 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 6: Injection began at 1.02 p. m., injected 3.5 cc 2 per cent caffein (42 mg
per kilo) in four minutes, 0.6 cc more within the next two and one-half minutes, total
amount injected 4.1 cc; 1.10 p. m., hypersensitive, some disturbance of muscular
coordination; restlessness; 1.35. p. m., reflexes decreased, urinated and walked about,
gait normal. Under observation for several days; no symptoms noted.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 564. Gray female. Weight, 1,515 grams.</i></p>

<p>February 6: Injection began at 1.26 p. m., 3.5 cc 2 per cent caffein (46 mg per kilo)
injected at the rate of 1 cc per minute; 1.30 p. m., reflexes increased; 1.34 p. m.,
marked paresis of the extremities, rabbit stretched out on abdomen, legs abducted
and partly extended, able to hop about but gait disturbed, no untoward symptoms
noticed, under observation for several days after experiment.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 565. Gray female. Weight, 1,545 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 6: Started to inject at 3.40 p. m., received 2.5 cc 2 per cent caffein intravenously
in two minutes or 32 mg per kilo, under observation all afternoon, no
symptoms.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 566. Gray female. Weight, 1,900 grams. Diet oats.</i></p>

<p>February 6: Injection began at 3.05 p. m., received 3 cc 2 per cent caffein intravenously
in three minutes or 31 mg per kilo, no symptoms observed.</p>

<p>These experiments show that a dose of about 50 mg per kilo when injected intravenously
produces mild symptoms, such as increased reflexes. In the four experiments
with this amount of caffein these effects were observed in each case. In the
experiments in which smaller quantities, 30 mg per kilo, were given intravenously
there was no manifestation of symptoms. A dose not over 50 mg per kilo may, therefore,
be regarded as the minimum toxic dose when injected intravenously under the
conditions stated.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series D.</span></p>

<p>A 0.5 per cent caffein solution was used in these experiments in order to test the
effect of concentration on its toxicity; the rate of injection was 1 cc per minute.</p>



<p>
<i>Rabbit 569. Gray male. Weight, 1,475 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 6: 11.50 a. m. to 12.01 p. m., injected 10 cc 0.5 per cent caffein; 12.03
to 12.12 p. m., injected 10 cc of 0.5 per cent caffein; 12.13 to 12.26 p. m., injected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
10 cc of 0.5 per cent caffein, total amount injected, 30 cc; 12.20, passed 35 cc of urine;
12.30, increased reflexes, but no convulsions; 4 p. m., reflexes increased.</p>

<p>February 11: Alive, condition good.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 574. Gray female. Weight, 1,555 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 8: 10.25 to 10.33 a. m., injected 4 cc of 0.5 per cent caffein in salt solution,
injection discontinued for five minutes; 10.38 to 11.10, injected 30 cc, total amount
of caffein solution received, 34 cc; 11.55 a. m., very sensitive; reflexes markedly
increased.</p>

<p>February 9: Alive, condition good.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 571. Gray female. Weight, 1,530 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 7: Injection 3.18 to 3.50 p. m., received 30 cc in 32 minutes, not hypersensitive;
3.55, restlessness and weakness of extremities; 4.10 p. m., control of anterior
extremities impaired, distinctly paretic but tried to walk about, died the same
afternoon.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 568. Gray male. Weight, 1,605 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 7: Injection 10.53 to 11.01 a. m., injected 10 cc 0.5 per cent caffein; 11.03,
injection resumed after two minutes interval; 11.14, received 10 cc 0.5 per cent
caffein intravenously in 11 minutes; 11.16, injection resumed; 11.35, received 12 cc
0.5 per cent caffein, total amount of caffein solution received, 32 cc; 12.30 p. m.,
urinated 14 cc of bloody urine; 12.55 p. m., convulsions and death a few minutes later.
Autopsy showed congestion of viscera, but no other lesions.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 570. Gray female. Weight, 1,225 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 7: 2.06 to 2.35 p. m., injected 24.5 cc 0.5 per cent caffein, reflexes increased
but no convulsions, paresis especially marked in the anterior extremities; 3 p. m.,
passed urine which was normal in appearance, reflexes not increased but rabbit was
weak.</p>

<p>February 9: Found dead. <i>Autopsy</i>: Liver, spleen, and kidneys congested; large
intestines hemorrhagic; omentum congested and showed the presence of small caseous
nodules; liver showed adhesion to diaphragm; viscera presented the appearance of
intraabdominal infection.</p>

<p>Of the five rabbits of this series three died as a result of the administration of caffein.
The other two which survived showed mild symptoms only, such as increased reflexes,
but no evidence of severe poisoning such as was observed after the injection of the
same doses of caffein in series A when a 2 per cent solution of caffein was injected.
Convulsions were noticed in one case only (No. 568); paresis in two cases (Nos. 570
and 571). The nervous symptoms even in this group, therefore, were much milder
than in series A. The percentage of death, however, was greater than in series A, in
which the concentration of caffein was four times as great. It is quite probable that
the strain on the heart due to the sudden increase in volume of the blood and its dilution
might be an important factor in increasing the toxicity of caffein. It is conceivable
that doses just sufficiently large to depress the normal heart may cause paralysis
of an already overstrained organ.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series E.</span></p>

<p>In the two experiments of this series the rate of injection as a possible factor influencing
the toxicity of caffein was tested. A 2 per cent caffein solution was injected
at the rate of 1 cc in two and one-half to three minutes.</p>



<p>
<i>Rabbit 572. Gray male. Weight, 1,770 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 8: Injection began at 3 p. m., discontinued at 3.37 p. m., and resumed at
3.38 p. m.; rabbit was restless; injection finished at 3.52 p. m. Total quantity received,
17.4 cc 2 per cent caffein intravenously in 52 minutes; struggled intermittently during
the injection; anterior legs paralyzed.</p>

<p>February 9: Found dead.</p>



<p><i>Rabbit 573. Gray male. Weight, 1,810 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>February 8: Started to inject at 1.35 and discontinued at 2.27 p. m.; received 18 cc
2 per cent caffein intravenously in 52 minutes; reflexes markedly increased soon
after; 2.45, passed bloody urine; 4.30 p. m. reflexes increased; no other symptoms.</p>

<p>February 9: 9 a. m., found dead.</p>

<p>It will be observed that some retardation of the onset of symptoms was caused by
slower injection, but the final result was the same as when the injections were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
more rapidly. It is quite probable, therefore, that a much slower rate of injection
may lessen considerably the toxicity of caffein.</p>

<p>From the results of the experiments by intravenous injection summarized in the
table, it appears that the minimum toxic dose for rabbits of a 2 per cent caffein solution,
injected at the rate of 1 cc per minute, is about 50 mg per kilo. Twice the dose
induces severe symptoms and may be fatal; 160 mg per kilo are surely fatal. If the
rate of injection is diminished, the toxicity of caffein is lessened, but this effect is
not marked unless the injections are very slow. Dilution of the caffein solution suppresses
to some extent the nervous symptoms, but the toxicity, on the contrary, seems
to be increased.</p>

<h4><a id="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The results of the experiments on rabbits show considerable variation in the toxicity
of the single dose. Individuals differed so widely in their resistance to this drug
that the same experiments had to be repeated many times with each method of administration
before satisfactory conclusions could be drawn. This is strikingly
illustrated in the experiments by intravenous injection in which a dose of nearly 0.2
gram per kilo was not fatal. Similar instances of exceptional resistance or of sensitiveness
to caffein were observed when it was given in other ways. A comparison
of the toxicity of caffein administered by different methods in this investigation
shows well-marked differences in its activity, although they are not quite so striking
as similar experiments with other alkaloids reported by several observers. The toxicity
of caffein in these experiments on the rabbit indicates that it is greatest when
given by vein and least when given by mouth. The ratio of the minimum toxic
doses by these two methods of introduction of caffein was about 7.1; the relation of
the minimum fatal dose was about 3.1. The toxicity when given subcutaneously is
about 15 to 20 per cent greater than when given by mouth. The difference between
the intramuscular and subcutaneous injection is even more marked. The toxicity
of caffein when injected into the muscles is about midway between that administered
by the subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes, and is about half that injected
intravenously. Meltzer and Auer,<a href="#a58"><sup>58</sup></a> who experimented with a number of drugs
found that the intramuscular method of administration is as effective as the intravenous,
fluorescin forming the only exception according to their observations. In the experiments
of Sollman and Brown<a href="#a81"><sup>81</sup></a> with ergot, the effect was quite different from those
obtained by Meltzer and Auer<a href="#a58"><sup>58</sup></a> with the drugs they used. It is quite possible that
the result obtained with ergot is merely illustrative of a difference in the behavior of
various substances in this regard. This appears probable on account of the difference
in the rate of absorption for various substances. Thus, according to Achard, Gaillard,
and Ribot (Compt. rend. Soc. biol., 1907, <i>62</i>: 90), absorption from the peritoneal
cavity varies with the concentration of the solution and the size of the molecule. The
smaller the molecule and the greater the concentration the more rapid the absorption.
That the rate of absorption from the intramuscular tissues is unequal and
varies for different substances appears from the experiments of Meltzer and Auer.<a href="#a58"><sup>58</sup></a>
The difference was very striking between intramuscular and subcutaneous administration
of curara or adrenalin; the results were somewhat different with morphin and
with fluorescin. As shown in their protocols, the onset of the symptoms after the
intramuscular injection of morphin was sooner than after subcutaneous injection,
but in time the difference diminishes and disappears altogether. The absorption of
fluorescin is much faster when the intramuscular path is used than when given subcutaneously,
but the writers state that the rate falls far behind that of the intravenous
administration. The difference in toxicity we observed between feeding by mouth
and subcutaneous injection, although distinct, was not very great. It was much
less than Maurel<a href="#a55"><sup>55</sup></a> obtained with the hydrobromid of caffein in the rabbit. Whether
this difference between his results and ours is due to the use of the pure alkaloid in
our experiments and the hydrobromid employed by Maurel can not be stated at
present with any degree of accuracy. It is hoped that the work in progress in the
laboratory will throw some light on the subject in the near future. But Maurel's<a href="#a56"><sup>56</sup></a>
experiments show that various substances behave differently in this regard. Thus
the toxicity of strychnin, he states, is three times as great when given subcutaneously
as when given by mouth and six times that of the minimum fatal dose by vein.
It may be remarked, however, that examination of his data shows that his doses are
much too large for the rabbit. In experiments with other drugs little or no difference
between the two modes of administration was noticed. Thus, digitalin was but
slightly more active when given subcutaneously than by mouth, while the toxicity
of emetin hydrochlorid was just the same, whichever one of these methods of intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>ducing
the substance was used. Differences in the toxicity of substances have also
been observed between subcutaneous and intravenous modes of administration,
but here, too, the differences for various substances were unequal.</p>


<h3><a id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_GUINEA_PIGS"></a>EXPERIMENTS ON GUINEA PIGS.</h3>

<p>The toxicity of caffein was studied in a large number of individuals. The experiments
were conducted on full-grown animals and were carried out at different seasons
of the year in a variety of ways. Special attention was given to diet as a possible
factor influencing resistance to caffein, and the effect of different modes of administration
on toxicity. Some animals were therefore fed oats, some carrots, others received
both hay and oats. Caffein was introduced subcutaneously, intraperitoneally,
and by mouth.</p>


<h4><a id="SUBCUTANEOUS_INJECTIONg"></a>SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION.</h4>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series A.</span></p>

<p>Preliminary experiments carried out on three guinea pigs, which received 360,
300, and 290 mg of caffein per kilo subcutaneously have shown that such doses were
rapidly fatal. Two of the animals were seized with convulsions half an hour after
the introduction of caffein and died during the attack. The other had tetanus two
minutes after the injection of caffein. Repeated attacks followed, which terminated
in the death of the animal two and a half hours later. The fatal and toxic doses must
therefore be considerably under 0.3 gram of caffein per kilo when introduced by this
path and smaller doses were therefore injected. The results are shown in the experiments
of the next series.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>Experiments with 2 decigrams per kilo constituted this series.</p>



<p>
<i>Guinea pig 20. Female. Weight, 497 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>April 2: 5 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously at 11.30 a. m.; 1.50 p. m.,
spasm of short duration. Died at 3 p. m., three and one-half hours after injection.</p>



<p><i>Guinea pig 38. Brown male. Weight, 570 grams. Diet, carrots and oats week previous
to injection.</i></p>

<p>February 11: 3.50 p. m., 6 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously in back
(210 mg per kilo); 4.15, reflexes increased, had convulsion of short duration when
disturbed; 4.45 p. m., on handling, repeated convulsion and paralysis; 5 p. m., guinea
pig lying on his side, respiration difficult and labored.</p>

<p>February 11: 5.05 p. m., guinea pig found dead, 2 hours and 15 minutes after
injection.</p>



<p><i>Guinea pig 37. Male. Weight, 820 grams. Diet, carrots and oats during week preceding
the injection of caffein.</i></p>

<p>February 11: 3.35 p. m., 8.5 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously in the
back; 5 p. m., pig very sensitive, anterior extremities paralyzed when handled, frequent
spasms of posterior extremities, no symptoms noticed before 5 p. m., although
watched all the time; 5.05 p. m., guinea pig on his legs and looked normal. No attack
on handling.</p>

<p>February 12: 9 a. m., found dead; died within 18 hours.</p>



<p><i>Guinea pig 13. Female. Weight, 618 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>March 29: 2.45, 6 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously (0.194 grams per
kilo).</p>

<p>March 30: Died at 4 p. m., 25 hours after injection.</p>



<p><i>Guinea pig 36. Male. Weight, 850 grams. Fed oats and carrots for one week previous
to injection.</i></p>

<p>February 11: 3.30 p. m., 8.5 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously into
back; 5 p. m., somewhat more sensitive than normal, no other symptoms, no effect
on handling; 5.05 p. m., no symptoms.</p>

<p>February 12: 9 a. m., found dead, about 18 hours after injection.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments, as observed in five guinea pigs, indicate that
two decigrams of caffein per kilo of animal produce symptoms within a half to about
two and a quarter hours after injection. Death followed in two guinea pigs 70 minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to 1 hour after the first manifestations of symptoms. Two others died during the
night, while one lived 25 hours after the injection of caffein. Even 2 decigrams
caffein per kilo weight might therefore be fatal to the guinea pig. Experiments
carried out later have shown, however, that the resistance to caffein is appreciably
greater in some guinea pigs. This is indicated by the following experiments, in which
doses of 0.2 to 0.24 gram caffein per kilo were administered by the same path.</p>

administered by subcutaneous injection; 3.35 p. m., reflexes increased.</p>

<p>October 10: found dead. <i>Autopsy</i>: Nos. 70, 71, 72 showed congestion of organs.</p>

<p>The reaction to caffein in the experiments of this series (C) showed considerable
variation. The appearance of symptoms, as well as the final outcome of the experiments,
differed markedly in a number of cases, notwithstanding the fact that the
conditions were the same; thus the administration of 0.2 gram per kilo to guinea
pigs, all of which received the same diet, induced no symptoms in two of the animals
(Nos. 66 and 65), while marked symptoms were observed in the other four; in two
of these the symptoms appeared in one hour and a quarter after injection, and in two
others (Nos. 68 and 69), mild symptoms only appeared in 20 or 25 minutes. The
last two were under observation for 4 hours longer, but there was no visible change
in their condition. The duration of life in all of these guinea pigs, as indicated in
the table, likewise varied. Two (Nos. 60 and 68) died during the night after they
received caffein, one survived (No. 65), and three others (Nos. 57, 66, and 69) lived
2½, 5, and 9 days, respectively. Experiments with larger doses likewise showed
differences in the behavior of these animals toward caffein, but they were not quite
so marked. As shown in the table, symptoms appeared in from 35 minutes to 1.5 hours
after injection. The duration of life was less than 1 day in two pigs, about twice as
long in two others, and in one case between 2 and 3 days.</p>

<p>A comparison made with results obtained in the preceding series shows a striking
difference in the resistance to caffein. As 2 decigrams per kilo proved more rapidly
fatal to the guinea pig than the larger doses employed in the later experiments, this
difference in the resistance to caffein may be due to several factors. As pointed out
in the experiments on rabbits, age might be an important factor influencing the
toxicity of caffein. Unfortunately, no accurate data were available on the age of the
guinea pigs, but they were all apparently full grown, although they differed in weight
considerably. The difference in their ages was in all probability not very great.
Moreover, it will be observed that the resistance in series B and C differed in animals
of approximately the same weight. This is evident on comparing experiments Nos.
20, 38, and 13 of series B with Nos. 65, 66, and 69 of the next series. Again, further
inspection and analysis of these tables show no difference in the toxicity, although
there may be considerable difference in the weight, from which it may be concluded
that the animals were of about the same age or that this plays no part in the resistance
to caffein in the guinea pig.</p>

<p>Diet is another factor which should be taken into consideration in this connection.
The recent work of Hunt<a href="#a39"><sup>39</sup></a> indicates that this may influence the resistance of animals
to some poisons. Our experiments, however, fail to show any difference in the toxicity
of the caffein in guinea pigs, whether fed oats, carrots, or both, for different results were
obtained on the same diet, and there seemed to be little or no difference in the toxicity
of caffein when the diet was different. Other explanations suggest themselves to
account for the results obtained. Seasonal changes have been assigned by a number
of investigators as a cause of variation in the resistance to drugs. According to Focke,<a href="#a24"><sup>24</sup></a>
frogs are more susceptible to digitalis in the spring than in the summer, while Moschkowitsch<a href="#a61"><sup>61</sup></a>
and Edmunds<a href="#a21"><sup>21</sup></a> reported the very opposite results. Schmiedeberg's<a href="#a80"><sup>80</sup></a>
observations on strophantin in frogs were in harmony with those of Edmunds<a href="#a21"><sup>21</sup></a> and
Moschkowitsch.<a href="#a61"><sup>61</sup></a> Similar results were reported with guinea pigs. Harrington's<a href="#a34"><sup>34</sup></a>
experiments indicate that stimulation of the vagus is less effective from October to
January than from February to April, when they are also much more susceptible to
operative procedure. Hunt found that the resistance of guinea pigs to aceto nitril is
about twice as great in the summer months as it is in January and February.</p>

<p>Race might also be thought of as an important factor in this connection. Since the
guinea pigs used at different seasons of the year were of several varieties, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
reason to suppose, however, that the varieties experimented upon in the summer
were more resistant than those used in the winter and spring. It is highly probable,
therefore, that the greater resistance to caffein of the guinea pigs of series C than those
of series B was due to seasonal variation.</p>

<p>Doses of 0.20 to 0.24 gram caffein per kilo weight, therefore, may be regarded as the
minimum fatal dose for the guinea pig, depending upon the season. Since 0.2 gram
per kilo proved to be rapidly fatal in series B, this quantity was perhaps not the
minimum fatal dose for the guinea pig at the season during which the experiments
were made. Additional tests with smaller doses were therefore carried out during
February and March. The results are shown in series D.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series D.</span></p>

<p>February 14: 2 p. m., pig alive; apparently normal.</p>

<p>February 18: Guinea pig still alive and apparently in good condition.</p>



<p><i>Guinea pig 46. Female. Weight, 470 grams. Diet, oats about one month previous to
experiment.</i></p>

<p>March 17: 3.15 p. m., 4 cc (0.170 gram per kilo) 2 per cent caffein injected into back
subcutaneously; 4.35 p. m., reflexes increased, tremors on handling marked; 5.40 p.
m., no change, symptoms about as before.</p>

<p>March 18: 2.30 p. m., no symptoms.</p>

<p>The experiments of this series (D) likewise showed a considerable difference in the
resistance of the individual guinea pigs. Nos. 41, 45, and 46 survived; the rest of
the pigs died within 18 hours to 2 days after the administration of caffein. Since an
autopsy was held on one only, it is impossible to assign a cause for the variation in the
toxicity of caffein in these guinea gigs, as the diet and the other conditions under
which the experiments were conducted were the same. It was found in the experiments
on cats and rabbits that the presence of morbid processes tends to increase the
toxicity of caffein. The observations of Ophüls<a href="#a66"><sup>66</sup></a> are of interest in this connection.
He found spontaneous lesions of the kidney and liver in a large proportion of guinea
pigs examined. The greater susceptibility to caffein of guinea pigs Nos. 39, 40, 49,
is probably due therefore to some pathological change which increased its toxicity.
About 0.2 to 0.24 gram per kilo may therefore be regarded as the minimum lethal
dose for the normal guinea pig when caffein is introduced subcutaneously, the minimum
toxic dose being about 150-160 mg per kilo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Experiments were also conducted to determine the largest dose which does not produce
any visible effects. In a number of tests with from 100 to 120 mg caffein per
kilo (series E, see Table 6, <a href="#Page_51">p. 51</a>) no manifestation of nervous or muscular disturbance
nor any departure from the normal in respiratory activity was observed. Such
quantities may be regarded as the largest doses which are surely safe for these animals.
It is quite possible, therefore, that the greater variation in the toxicity of caffein
observed in these experiments is due to morbid conditions. Moreover, there is some
evidence that caffein increases the toxicity of certain poisons, as shown by Hale<a href="#a33"><sup>33</sup></a> for
acetanilid. Is it not possible that caffein may similarly be affected by poisons circulating
within the body? Indeed the recent work of Loeb<a href="#a23"><sup>23</sup></a> makes this supposition
highly probable. This investigator found that caffein and adrenalin injected together
produce myocarditis in the rabbit. It is conceivable that the combined action of
caffein and some preexisting poison may cause changes which terminate in the death
of the animal. The delayed death of guinea pigs after the administration of caffein
observed in this and other series may probably be accounted for in this way.</p>

<p>Experiment 57 lends some support to this view. The condition of the kidneys and
the presence of a severe gastro-enteritis are sufficient to account for the death of this
case. Again the frequent association of gastro-enteritis and congestion of the organs
in caffein intoxication found in different animals makes it highly probable that these
lesions were caused by caffein.</p>

<p><i>Guinea pig 63. Gray and white male. Weight, 340 grams. Diet, oats.</i></p>

<p>October 5: 11.20 a. m., 4 cc of 2 per cent caffein (235 mg per kilo) injected into
peritoneal cavity.</p>

<p>October 14: Alive and in good condition.</p>



<p><i>Guinea pig 64. Brown and black female. Weight, 305 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 5: 11.35 a. m., 3.8 cc 2 per cent solution caffein (250 mg per kilo) injected
into peritoneal cavity; 11.40 a. m., tetanus&mdash;survived, convulsions off and on, died
at 4.15 p. m. <i>Autopsy</i>: Findings exactly the same as in No. 67.</p>

<p>Examination of the results of the experiments by intraperitoneal injections showed
that 0.2 gram caffein per kilo was toxic in two guinea pigs (Nos. 59 and 58). Severe
symptoms were observed within 15 minutes in No. 56 and within one hour in No.
55 after the administration of approximately the same dose of caffein. One of these
died within three and one-half hours; the other, No. 56, made a good recovery from
the acute effects. This amount of caffein may be regarded, therefore, as the minimum
toxic dose for the guinea pig when injected into the peritoneal cavity. This
is corroborated by the experiments of series B in which smaller doses failed to show
any muscular, nervous, or respiratory symptoms, nor were there any after effects
noticed, as all of them survived and were kept under observation for some time.
The guinea pigs of series A, however, seem to contradict these results. It will be
remarked that appreciably smaller doses induced symptoms in all of them, and one
case terminated fatally. The seasonal variation, as already pointed out, is in all
probability likewise responsible for the difference in the resistance between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
guinea pigs of series A and B. Tests were made also to determine the minimum
fatal dose. For this purpose the experiments of series D were performed. The
resistance of No. 63 in this series is quite striking. We are unable to explain such
a discrepancy in the results obtained under practically uniform conditions. The
minimum fatal dose of caffein, when injected into the peritoneal cavity, is therefore
about 240 to 250 milligrams per kilo. These amounts, it will be observed, were
rapidly fatal, in striking contrast to the results obtained when such doses were injected
subcutaneously. This is probably due to a better absorption from the peritoneal
cavity than from the subcutaneous tissues.</p>


<h4><a id="ADMINISTRATION_BY_MOUTHg"></a>ADMINISTRATION BY MOUTH.</h4>

<p>All the guinea pigs in these experiments were kept on a diet of hay and oats and
were of large size. The tests were made with different doses of caffein in order to
determine the limits of toxicity when the drug was administered by mouth.</p>

<p>Examination of the protocols shows that the absorption of caffein from the gastro-intestinal
canal was quite rapid, symptoms having been observed as early as 20 minutes
after its introduction. The duration of life, it will be remarked, varied with the
size of the dose. When approximately 3 decigrams per kilo were fed, all the animals
died in the night. They lived, therefore, less than 18 hours. Two decigrams per kilo
were likewise fatal, but the duration of life was longer. To decide whether or not this
is the smallest fatal dose, smaller amounts were fed. It seemed at first that about 150
mg per kilo was the smallest toxic dose, and about 200 mg per kilo the minimum fatal
dose. Macroscopic examination of the organs, however, threw some doubt on this
supposition, for well-marked lesions were noticed in all of the guinea pigs which
received 0.2 gram per kilo. It is quite possible, therefore, that the minimum fatal
dose may be somewhat higher, as we have reason to believe that, at least in some pathologic
conditions, the susceptibility to caffein is increased. The presence of fatty
changes in the liver of No. 128 and the rapid death in this case lends especial support
to this view. Hence, the minimum fatal dose is probably greater than 0.2 gram per
kilo for the normal guinea pig. The doses employed for the tests on guinea pigs Nos.
129, 130, and 131 may be considered therefore the minimum fatal dose for these animals.
It will be also remarked that macroscopical examination of the organs of these animals
failed to reveal the presence of severe lesions. That the minimum toxic dose is probably
much smaller than 0.28 gram per kilo is indicated by the experiments on guinea
pigs Nos. 135 and 134, in which 0.15 gram caffein per kilo induced mild symptoms
in from two to three hours. Both of these, however, and also No. 137 died four to six
days after the drug was fed. As already pointed out, caffein may be a factor in the
delayed death of guinea pigs which received moderate doses of it. That this supposition
may also be true for guinea pigs Nos. 134, 135, and 137 is indeed made probable
by the observation that after moderate amounts of caffein symptoms may persist in
the guinea pig for about 24 hours, and also by the fact that the secretion of urine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
these animals was very scanty, as shown in the preceding record of the experiments;
this means slow elimination of caffein and its products of decomposition. It is conceivable
that the presence of toxic amounts of caffein in the body for a considerable
length of time would induce changes that ultimately lead to the death of the animal
or that morbid processes are set up by the combined action of caffein and some preexisting
poison. Since some guinea pigs, however, survived the doses indicated, it
is more probable that such changes would be brought about by caffein in the presence
of a preexisting poison. The death of these pigs, and also of No. 137 several days later,
is difficult to account for on any other theory than the one suggested. Were it not for
the fact that controls, that is, animals of the same lot which had not received caffein
survived all of the experimental animals, changed conditions of environment or accident
might be considered the cause of death in the guinea pigs of the last series.</p>

<h4><a id="SUMMARYg"></a>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>A survey of the results obtained in experiments on guinea pigs shows that the mode
of introduction of caffein exerts but little influence on its toxicity. On careful analysis
it will be observed that the rate of absorption after the administration of caffein by
mouth, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally is about the same for the time of appearance
of symptoms. The persistence of the symptoms of caffein intoxication observed
in these experiments for 24 hours after administration points to slow elimination,
which may be expected, owing to the fact that the guinea pigs passed but little urine
and caffein is not diuretic for these animals. The prolonged presence of caffein
in the body probably exerts a harmful influence or after effect, which may account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for the delayed death of some animals many days after a single dose of caffein was given.
Among the factors which undoubtedly influence toxicity, season should be considered,
while the presence of a diseased condition undoubtedly tends to decrease the resistance
of the guinea pig to caffein. Diet was without any influence on the toxicity of
the single dose of caffein.</p>


<h3><a id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_CATS"></a>EXPERIMENTS ON CATS.</h3>

<p>These experiments were performed on well-fed animals which were kept under
observation for several days before the tests with caffein were made. The diet consisted
of meat exclusively. In some cases the urine was examined for albumin and
sugar before caffein was given. No tests with caffein were made if large amounts of
albumin were found. It may be remarked that sugar was never found in cats before
the administration of caffein, but that considerable amounts of it were found in some
cases after it was given. Studies by various modes of administration were made, by
subcutaneous injection, intraperitoneally, or by mouth. Attention was also directed
to the resistance to caffein in young cats, several experiments on kittens being made
with this object in view.</p>


<h4><a id="SUBCUTANEOUS_INJECTIONc"></a>SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION.</h4>

<p>Rost stated that caffein is eliminated in the urine unchanged after its introduction
into the body and that the amounts found varied with different species of animals.
In the rabbit the amount eliminated was about 21 per cent; in the dog about 8 per cent;
and in the cat somewhat less than 2.5 per cent. It would appear, therefore, that the
cat decomposes caffein more readily than the rabbit or dog; its resistance consequently
ought to be greater than that of the other animals. Moderately large doses were accordingly
employed in the preliminary experiments (series A), but the results obtained, as
shown in the protocols, indicated that caffein is fully as toxic for the cat as for the
rabbit or dog. The doses were then decreased and experiments were performed in
order to ascertain the smallest toxic as well as the smallest fatal dose.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series A.</span></p>

<p>Three decigrams of caffein per kilo were administered in these experiments. The
results are shown in the following protocols:</p>



<p>
<i>Cat 4. Black and white. Weight, 1,440 grams.</i></p>

<p>May 26: 10.05 a. m., 22 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.3 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously;
11.10 a. m., copious salivation, cat irritable, muscular stiffness present, but
no tetanus; 11.45 a. m., cat restless, convulsions, attacks of short duration, no paralysis
observed after the convulsions, pupils dilated; 4.45 p. m., cat quiet, slight paralysis
present.</p>

<p>May 27: Cat exhausted.</p>

<p>May 28: Found dead.</p>



<p><i>Cat 5. Black and white male. Weight, 1,396 grams.</i></p>

<p>June 3: 10 a. m. 21 cc of 2 per cent caffein (0.3 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously;
12 noon, found dead.</p>

<p>Although there was considerable difference in the duration of life following the
injection of the same dose of caffein per kilo, the final outcome was the same, as both
cats died from the effects of the drug. One died within 2 hours and the other lived
more than 30 hours after its administration. Three decigrams of caffein per kilo is,
therefore, surely fatal to these animals. Tests made with smaller doses are shown in
the following experiments:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>In these experiments the doses employed ranged between 0.20 and 0.25 gram caffein
per kilo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>



<p><i>Cat 3. Black and white female. Weight, 2,854 grams. Well fed.</i></p>

<p>June 4: 10.30 a. m., 35 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.25 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously;
11 a. m., found dead.</p>



<p><i>Cat 6. Black and white. Weight, 1,645 grams.</i></p>

<p>June 3: 20 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.243 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously at 3
p. m., cat grew very irritable in a few minutes; about 4 p. m. reflexes decidedly
increased; 5 p. m., cat paralyzed.</p>

<p>June 4: Cat found dead.</p>



<p><i>Cat 8. Weight, 1,735 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 7: 4 p. m., 22 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.25 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously
in the back; 4.30 p. m., cat irritable, salivation profuse, convulsions; died at
5.30 p. m.; no urine passed after caffein was given.</p>



<p><i>Cat 9. Weight, 1,960 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 7: 3.45 p. m., 25 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.25 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously
in the back; 4.45 p. m., cat very irritable, repeated attacks of convulsions,
salivation copious; died at 5.30 p. m.; cat did not urinate after injection of caffein.</p>



<p><i>Cat 12. Striped kitten. Weight, 1,185 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 9: Urine examined, no albumin, no sugar; 1.45 p. m., 12 cc 2 per cent
caffein administered; 5 p. m., cat alive, no symptoms except salivation and general
irritability.</p>

<p>October 10: 10.30 a. m., found dead. About 15 cc urine collected, but no examination
made.</p>



<p><i>Cat 14. Black. Weight, 1,855 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 8: 1.40 p. m., 18.5 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.2 gram per kilo); 3 p. m., cat
became restless about 10 minutes after caffein was injected; cried persistently and
moved about in cage, no convulsions, cat urinated about 15 cc, cat defecated.</p>

<p>October 9: 9 a. m., cat found dead in cage. Urine gave very heavy reduction of
Fehling's solution (much more than was obtained from urine of rabbits); 20 cc urine
analyzed contained 4.65 per cent sugar. <i>Autopsy</i>: Lungs deeply congested; liver
marked fatty infiltration and degeneration; spleen normal; kidneys pale and anemic;
intestines normal; stomach normal.</p>



<p><i>Cat 15. Striped. Weight, 2,145 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 8: 2 p. m., 22 cc (0.2 gram per kilo) 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously;
2.30 p. m., cat irritable, restless, trying to get out of cage, crying persistently;
2.40, convulsions lasting about two minutes, then cat raised itself and made attempts
to get out of cage, no salivation, cat urinated about 10 cc and defecated.</p>

<p>October 9: 9 a. m., cat found dead in cage, about 10 cc of urine contained enormous
quantities of sugar. <i>Autopsy</i>: Lungs severely congested; liver showed marked fatty
degeneration; spleen normal; kidneys slightly pale and anemic; intestines mildly congested;
stomach normal.</p>



<p><i>Cat 19. White. Weight, 1,100 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 20: 13 cc of 2 per cent caffein (0.236 gram per kilo). About 15 minutes
later cat became irritable, reflexes increased, persistent crying, stiffness of extremities,
diarrhea present; 4.30 p. m., stiffness of muscles, coordination much disturbed, walked
with great difficulty; 4.30 p. m., no new symptoms, persistent crying continued.</p>

<p>October 21: Found dead.</p>



<p><i>Cat 20. White kitten. Weight, 790 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 20: 11.35 a. m., 10 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.25 gram per kilo) given subcutaneously;
12 noon, convulsions followed by paralysis; 1.30 p. m., still breathing,
apparently in comatose condition, lay on its side, dyspn&oelig;a, profuse salivation; 4 p. m.,
convulsions and death.</p>

<p>The results of the experiments of series B show that a dose of even 0.2 caffein per kilo
is very toxic for the cat. Symptoms appeared in one animal 40 minutes after the injection
of caffein. Some of them were found dead 18 hours after injection, which means that
the duration of life was probably a great deal less since there was evidence that they
had been dead for some time. Death occurred quite soon after larger doses were
injected. Cat No. 3 died 30 minutes after it received caffein. The amounts employed
in these experiments can not be considered therefore as the minimum fatal doses.
Smaller doses were then tried, as shown in the experiments of the next series.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series C.</span></p>

<p>Experiments were performed on five cats which received from 140 to 155 mg per kilo,
as follows:</p>



<p>
<i>Cat 24. Striped. Weight, 1,300 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 25: 10 a. m., 50 cc urine, albumin moderate amount&mdash;no sugar; 10 cc caffein
injected subcutaneously at 12 noon; 12.30, irritable, cried persistently, no appetite;
4 p. m., no convulsions, but persistent crying.</p>

<p>October 27: Cat was still alive.</p>



<p><i>Cat 17. Weight, 2,620 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 12: 9.30 a. m., 65 cc urine collected; more than a trace of albumin present,
no reduction of Fehling's solution; 3 p. m., 20 cc 2 per cent caffein (150 mg per kilo)
injected subcutaneously; 3.15 p. m., irritable and restless.</p>

<p>October 13: 9 a. m., about 15 cc urine collected, reduction of Fehling's solution
marked; osazone test also positive.</p>



<p><i>Cat 23. Black and white. Weight, 1,645 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 25: 10 a. m., 140 cc urine collected (since October 23), small amount of
albumin present, no sugar.</p>

<p>October 27: 9 a. m., no albumin; no sugar in urine; 11.50 a. m., 12.5 cc caffein injected
subcutaneously (0.15 gram per kilo); 1 p. m., convulsions and death.</p>



<p><i>Cat 7. Striped kitten. Weight, 1,285 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 11: Urine collected, no albumin, no sugar; 9.50 a. m., 10 cc 2 per cent caffein
injected subcutaneously in the back; 10.10, violent convulsions lasting about 30
seconds; 10.20, convulsions of shorter duration; 10.30 convulsions; 10.35, convulsions
lasting a few seconds; urine passed about 10.20, contained a moderate amount of albumin,
but there was no reduction of Fehling's solution; 10.45, profuse salivation and
paralysis; died about 10.50.</p>



<p><i>Cat 39. Yellow. Weight, 2,285 grams.</i></p>

<p>April 13: 2.40 p. m., 16 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.14 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously
in the back; 3.45 p. m., cat died.</p>

<p>Of the five experiments of this series three died after doses of 140, 150, and 155 mg
per kilo. The other two showed symptoms of toxicity, but survived a dose of 150 mg
per kilo which indicated that the minimum fatal dose was probably reached. To test
this supposition smaller doses were administered, as shown in the following experiments.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series D.</span></p>

<p>Ten cats were used for this series of experiments, and the doses administered varied
between 103 and 139 mg per kilo. The results shown in the appended table (<a href="#Page_58">p.58</a>) indicate
that about 120 to 140 mg of caffein per kilo may induce mild symptoms in some
cases. The conclusion may be safely drawn therefore that 150 mg per kilo is approximately
the minimum fatal dose for the cat when the drug is given subcutaneously.
That smaller doses are, however, by no means to be regarded as always safe is shown in
the following experiments.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series E.</span></p>



<p>
<i>Cat 43. Weight, 3,225 grams.</i><a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>September 14: 10.20 a. m., 20 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.124 gram per kilo) injected into
the back; 11 a. m., tetanus and death. <i>Autopsy</i>: Lungs congested; liver congested
and showed hemorrhagic spots in capsules and fatty degeneration; kidneys slightly
congested; other organs normal.</p>



<p><i>Cat 48. Black female. Weight, 3,050 grams.</i></p>

<p>September 14: 18 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.118 gram per kilo) injected subcutaneously
in the back; 10.30 a. m., violent convulsions and death. <i>Autopsy</i>: Lungs congested in
spots showing numerous petechia; liver congested; spleen congested; other organs
normal.</p>

<p>The diminished resistance to caffein of cats Nos. 43 and 48 might be due to the
pathologic changes found on autopsy, for evidence is not wanting that the toxicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
of drugs might be greatly altered under pathological conditions. Hunt<a href="#a40"><sup>40</sup></a> has shown
that resistance to acetonitril is considerably diminished in chronic alcoholism. This
seems to be true also of other drugs under abnormal conditions. Smaller doses of
atropin<a href="#a78"><sup>78</sup></a> are required in lead poisoning than under normal conditions to produce
the same results. The following experiment is of interest in this connection, for in
this case a much smaller dose than was given in experiments Nos. 43 and 48 produced
the typical symptoms of caffein poisoning and proved to be fatal.</p>



<p>
<i>Cat 47, black and white male. Weight, 4,220 grams.</i></p>

<p>September 15: Received subcutaneously 18 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.084 gram per
kilo); no symptoms observed for about six hours.</p>

<p>September 16: No symptoms.</p>

<p>September 17: Weight, 4,250 grams; injected 18 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.084 gram
per kilo); tetanus and death after two hours. <i>Autopsy</i>: Severe hemorrhagic pneumonia;
kidneys pale, other organs normal.</p>

<p>Since two controls survived the same dose in proportion to the body weight of the
animal without showing any symptoms, the assumption is justified that the lower
resistance to caffein was due to the presence of pneumonia, thus affording additional
support to the view that the toxicity of caffein may be increased in disease.</p>


<h4><a id="INJECTION_INTO_THE_PERITONEAL_CAVITYc"></a>INJECTION INTO THE PERITONEAL CAVITY.</h4>

<p>These experiments were carried out on full-grown and on young subjects. As in
previous experiments, doses of different sizes were employed. A dose of 0.2 gram
per kilo was tried first and then reduced gradually to 0.1 gram per kilo.</p>



<p>
<i>Cat 10. Female. Weight, 2,970 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 9, 1909: 1.30 p. m., 30 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.2 gram per kilo) injected
into the peritoneal cavity; urine examined for albumin and sugar, negative; cat
found dead at 2.30 p. m. No urine in the bladder.</p>



<p><i>Cat 16. Black female. Weight, 2,420 grams.</i></p>

<p>October 9, 1910: Urine examined for albumin and sugar, negative; 2.30 p. m., 22 cc
2 per cent caffein (0.183 gram per kilo) injected into the peritoneal cavity; found
dead at 3 p. m.</p>



<p><i>Cat 99. Well-fed gray female. Weight, 3 kilos.</i></p>

<p>June 22, 1911: 3.40 p. m., 15 cc 2 per cent caffein injected into peritoneal cavity;
salivation and marked irritability within one hour after injection.</p>

<p>June 24: Alive, appetite good.</p>



<p><i>Cat 98. Well-fed black male. Weight, 4,100 grams.</i></p>

<p>June 22: 3.45 p. m., 20.5 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.1 gram per kilo) injected into
peritoneal cavity; very irritable a few minutes after injection, no other symptoms.</p>

<p>June 24: No symptoms, appetite good.</p>



<p><i>Cat 93. Black and white. Weight, 1,450 grams.</i></p>

<p>June 22: 3 p. m., 30 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.137 gram per kilo) injected into peritoneal
cavity; salivation, no other symptoms; under observation until 6 p. m.</p>

<p>June 23: 9 a. m., no urine, cat showed no symptoms.</p>

<p>June 24: 9 a. m., no symptoms, took nourishment as usual.</p>



<p><i>Cat 87. Well-fed white female. Weight, 2,615 grams.</i></p>

<p>June 23: 2.45 p. m., 19 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.145 gram per kilo) injected into peritoneal
cavity; became irritable and restless.</p>

<p>June 24: 9 a. m., no symptoms, took nourishment as usual.</p>



<p><i>Cat 97. Gray. Age, 3 months. Weight, 500 grams. Diet, meat.</i></p>

<p>June 24: 2.25 p. m., 5 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.2 gram per kilo) injected into peritoneal
cavity; 4 p. m., no symptoms.</p>

<p>June 29: Died.</p>



<p><i>Cat 96. Gray and white. Age, 3 months. Weight, 575 grams. Diet, meat.</i></p>

<p>June 24: 2.20 p. m., 4 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.139 gram per kilo) injected into peritoneal
cavity; 3.55 p. m., no symptoms.</p>

<p>June 30: Died.</p>



<p><i>Cat 95. Black. Age, about 3 months. Weight, 860 grams. Diet, meat.</i></p>

<p>June 24: 10.15 a. m., 8.6 cc 2 per cent caffein injected into peritoneal cavity, salivation
immediately after injection; 10.25, convulsions and paralysis; died 10.45 a. m.
<i>Autopsy</i>: Macroscopical examination of the organs, negative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>



<p><i>Cat 94. Black and white. Weight, 790 grams. Age, about 3 months. Diet, meat.</i></p>

<p>June 24: 10 a. m., 8 cc 2 per cent caffein injected into peritoneal cavity; 4 p. m.
under continual observation since injection, cat very irritable, respiration more rapid
than normal, diarrhea present.</p>

<p>Examination of the above protocols show that a dose of 2 decigrams per kilo was
fatal within one hour to one cat and that a somewhat smaller dose killed another
individual in 30 minutes. Amounts under 0.15 gram per kilo were just sufficient to
induce mild symptoms, such as increased irritability and salivation, which disappeared
within a few hours. In no case were the effects noticeable on the following
day. The experiments on young kittens are especially interesting, as they proved,
contrary to expectation, to be distinctly more resistant than full grown individuals.
The death of Nos. 97 and 96 within five and six days, respectively, can not be ascribed
to caffein, since some of the controls also died. Moreover, it will be remarked in
this connection that no symptoms appeared in three of the four young kittens after
the administration of a dose which was rapidly fatal to adult cats. The rapid death
of No. 95 after the same dose forms an exception which can not be accounted for, as
macroscopical examination at autopsy proved negative.</p>


<h4><a id="ADMINISTRATION_BY_MOUTHc"></a>ADMINISTRATION BY MOUTH.</h4>

<p>Two decigrams per kilo were given at first, but it was found that this amount was
surely fatal. The dose was therefore reduced to 0.125 gram per kilo. In all of these
experiments caffein was given by means of a soft rubber catheter slipped over the
stem of a funnel which served as a stomach tube. A 2 per cent aqueous solution was
used throughout these tests except in one case in which caffein was given mixed
with the food.</p>



<p>
<i>Cat 92. Black and white female. Weight, 1,750 grams.</i></p>

<p>June 10: 12.05 p. m., 14 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.16 gram per kilo) given by mouth;
cat was quiet when tied on holder, struggled only a little when tube was put into
stomach; 12.30 p. m., cat vomited, no other symptoms.</p>

<p>June 13: Condition good, appetite good.</p>



<p><i>Cat 87. White female. Weight, 2,620 grams. Diet, meat.</i></p>

<p>June 12: Given 0.4125 gram caffein in 150 grams of meat (150 mg per kilo), ate all
of it.</p>

<p>June 13: Found dead. <i>Autopsy</i>: Lungs congested, liver congested; other organs
apparently normal.</p>



<p><i>Cat 100. Gray female. Weight, 2,740 grams. Diet, meat.</i></p>

<p>July 17: 3 p. m., 17 cc of 2 per cent caffein (124 mg per kilo) given by mouth through
stomach tube at 3.20 p. m.; 5 p. m., very irritable, but no other symptoms.</p>

<p>July 18: Under observation all day, no symptoms.</p>



<p><i>Cat 93. Black and white female. Weight, 1,640 grams.</i></p>

<p>July 17: 3.30 p. m., 10 cc (0.125 gram per kilo) of 2 per cent caffein given by mouth
through stomach tube.</p>

<p>July 18: Under observation all day, no symptoms.</p>

<p>From the results of the experiments of this series it appears that 0.15 gram caffein
per kilo may be fatal within a few hours after its administration, even if the drug is
mixed with a moderate amount of meat. Experiments 87 and 92 show, however, that
this amount may be borne by some individuals without any serious consequences, as
the cats were under observation for some time after they received caffein, and no
untoward symptoms were noticed in either of them during this time. It may be
remarked that cat No. 92 vomited shortly after it received caffein. It is practically
certain, therefore, that this amount of caffein in proportion to the weight of the animal
will in the great majority of cases prove fatal, and perhaps in a smaller percentage of
individuals it is surely toxic if it does not escape absorption. Smaller doses may
cause irritability in some individuals, but symptoms referable to nervous symptoms
of muscles were absent, as in experiments Nos. 93 and 100. The minimum fatal dose
of caffein for the cat when given by mouth is, therefore, 0.15 gram per kilo.</p>

<h4><a id="SUMMARYc"></a>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The toxicity of caffein in cats is shown to be the same when given by mouth as
when injected subcutaneously, the minimum fatal doses in both cases being 0.15
gram per kilo. When introduced by the intraperitoneal route, caffein is, on the
contrary, distinctly less toxic. After the administration of 0.137 and 0.145 gram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
caffein per kilo (Nos. 93 and 87) salivation in one cat (No. 93) and irritability and
muscular stiffness in the other were the only effects noticed. These symptoms were
no longer observed the next day and the cats appeared to be perfectly normal. Experiments
with larger doses indicate that the minimum fatal dose by this method of
administration is about 0.2 gram per kilo.</p>


<h3><a id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_DOGS"></a>EXPERIMENTS ON DOGS.</h3>

<p>The experiments were carried out on well-fed adult dogs and on puppies, kept
under observation for some time before the drug was administered. Only those
manifesting no signs of abnormality were used for these tests. Caffein was given by
mouth mixed with 10 to 20 grams of meat, or subcutaneously in 2 per cent aqueous
solution. The young animals received caffein dissolved in milk. The determination
of the minimum toxic or fatal doses when the drug was fed presented considerable
difficulty, as in many instances the ingestion of the drug was closely followed by
vomiting.</p>


<h4><a id="ADMINISTRATION_BY_MOUTHd"></a>ADMINISTRATION BY MOUTH.</h4>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series A.</span></p>

<p>The effective dose in these experiments showed considerable variation. One dog
(No. 38) died after a dose of 0.12 gram caffein per kilo, while some subjects survived
doses of 0.2 and 0.23 gram per kilo. In the 12 experiments given in Table 12, page 62,
it will be noticed that from 0.12 to 0.152 gram per kilo proved fatal to three dogs,
while three others survived the same amounts in proportion to the body weight. The
results were the same with larger doses. It may be observed in this connection that
in the case of the five dogs in which vomiting was noticed some time during the 24
hours following the administration of caffein, four survived, No. 38 being the exception.
The greater toxicity of caffein in this case is in all probability due to some morbid
process, the presence of which was indicated by the high temperature of this subject.</p>

<p>That vomiting may avert a fatal issue after larger doses of caffein is made further
probable by experiment on dog No. 48, for which, in the absence of vomiting, a dose of
0.2 gram of caffein per kilo proved fatal. On this supposition the discrepancy in the
results obtained in this series may be readily explained. The smallest doses which
proved fatal in these experiments were 0.145 and 0.152 gram per kilo. No. 38, which
died from a dose of 0.12 gram per kilo, may be considered as an exception, as this subject
was not normal. Experiments with caffein on dogs were made at various other times
in this laboratory but failed to show that smaller doses of caffein, even when vomiting
did not occur after its administration, were fatal, although toxic effects were observed.
The conclusion is therefore justified that the minimum fatal dose of caffein for the
normal dog is about 0.15 gram per kilo when given by mouth.</p>


<h4><a id="SUBCUTANEOUS_INJECTIONd"></a>SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION.</h4>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>To determine the toxicity of caffein more accurately, especially for comparison
with animals of other species, the subcutaneous method of administration was also
used. The injections were made with a syringe of 20 cc capacity, the contents of
which were introduced into contiguous areas. The results of experiments on six
dogs indicate that approximately 150 to 160 mg per kilo is the minimum fatal dose,
since such doses proved fatal to two out of the three animals receiving this amount,
while three others which received doses of from 143 to 160 mg per kilo survived.</p>

<h4><a name="EXPERIMENTS_ON_PUPPIES" id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_PUPPIES">EXPERIMENTS ON PUPPIES.</a></h4>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series C.</span></p>

<p>In these experiments the resistance of young growing puppies to caffein was studied.
Caffein was given by mouth to all the subjects except one, to which it was administered
subcutaneously. The protocols, only a few of which are given, and the tabulated
data of the experiments (p. 62) show that the age of the animal has a decided
influence on the toxicity of caffein.</p>



<p>
<i>Dog 11. Weight, 1,260 grams.</i></p>

<p>August 2: At 10 a. m. given 12.5 cc of 2 per cent of caffein through stomach tube;
2 p. m., had convulsions, diarrhea, salivation, and stiffness of limbs.</p>

<p>August 3: Found dead 9 a. m. <i>Autopsy</i>: Thoracic viscera apparently normal;
stomach immensely distended and filled with a white, cheesy mass and some fluid;
round worms plentiful in stomach and small intestine; mucosa of entire intestine
congested; contents of lower intestine congested; liver pale; spleen flabby; kidney
congested.</p>



<p><i>Dog 10. Weight, 1,650 grams.</i></p>

<p>July 26: 9.30 a. m., 29 cc of 2 per cent caffein added to 60 cc of milk offered, but
refused, and was therefore fed by mouth through stomach tube; 10.25 a. m., no
symptoms; 11.30 a. m., restlessness, extremities stiff, post. extremities spread apart,
dog shows well-marked symptoms of caffein poisoning; 12.10 p. m., symptoms more
severe, extremities extended and spread out, is lying flat on belly so that nose touches
floor of the cage; 12.40 p. m., found dead; was alive at 12.10 p. m. <i>Autopsy</i>: Lungs
showed hemorrhagic foci in all lobes; heart apparently normal; liver fatty; stomach
and intestines filled with round worms; spleen and kidney apparently normal.</p>



<p><i>Dog 9. Weight, 3,000 grams.</i></p>

<p>July 25: 350 mg caffein per kilo; 5 p. m., lying down most of the time, occasionally
walks about in stall; restlessness present, but not marked; 5.30 p. m., vomit which
looked frothy and mucilaginous noticed on the floor of the stall; no meat particles
noticed in vomit, though searched for; whines occasionally.</p>

<p>July 26: 9 a. m., looks well; no signs of the effect of caffein given the day previous.</p>



<p><i>Dog 8. Yellow female. Weight, 3,100 grams.</i></p>

<p>July 22: 10.50 a. m., received 1.1 grams of caffein in 10 grams of meat (354 mg caffein
per kilo); 3 p. m., vomited mucus; gait clumsy; refused to eat; continually drinking
water; very restless; 4 p. m., convulsions set in at 3.55 p. m.; tonic rigidity of the
posterior extremities; profuse salivation; convulsions were both tonic and clonic in
character, and resembled those seen in rabbits in caffein intoxication; a striking
feature was the duration of the spasm, which began at 3.55 p. m. and kept up for more
than two hours.</p>

<p>July 23: Found dead at 9 a. m.</p>

<p>The data recorded in the table and in the protocols of the experiments of series C
show that four out of the seven animals experimented upon died in less than 24 hours
after caffein was fed; three of these received 300 to 354 mg caffein per kilo, and one
received 200 mg caffein per kilo. No. 8 vomited four hours after caffein was given.
No vomiting was observed in the other three dogs. From 0.300 to 0.350 gram of
caffein per kilo may be regarded, therefore, as surely fatal to young growing puppies.
That this is in all probability the minimum lethal dose appears from the following
experiments: No. 9, which received 350 mg per kilo, vomited one hour after and
survived, which indicates that some of it was probably not absorbed. The amount
which entered the circulation was therefore less than 350 mg per kilo. Since No. 15,
which received 250 mg caffein subcutaneously, likewise survived, the probabilities
are that 300 to 350 mg per kilo were the minimum fatal doses for these animals. Moreover,
No. 12, which received 200 mg caffein per kilo, survived, no vomiting having
been observed. The case of No. 11, in which the same amount of caffein in proportion
to body weight proved fatal, may be explained perhaps by the findings of the autopsy.</p>

<p>The results obtained in these experiments justify the conclusion that young growing
dogs can stand larger doses of caffein than full-grown and older dogs.</p>

<p>Attention may also be called here to the difference in the symptoms produced by
caffein in very young and in adult dogs. It was often noticed in these experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that the symptoms in older subjects when given toxic doses of caffein set in rather
abruptly and ended in instantaneous death. We failed to observe this phenomenon
after the administration of large amounts of caffein to very young dogs, in which tonic
and clonic convulsions alternating with paresis were observed. These symptoms set
in rather gradually and lasted several hours (see experiment No. 8), resembling the
rabbit in this regard.</p>


<h4><a id="SUMMARYd"></a>SUMMARY.</h4>

<p>The toxicity of caffein for adult dogs is about the same, whether given by mouth
or injected subcutaneously. The resistance of puppies to caffein is much greater than
that of adults.</p>

<h2><a name="CHRONIC_CAFFEIN_INTOXICATION" id="CHRONIC_CAFFEIN_INTOXICATION">CHRONIC CAFFEIN INTOXICATION.</a></h2>


<p>The object of this study was to ascertain the effect of repeated
dosage when caffein was given daily or at longer intervals. The
experiments were tried on rabbits and on dogs. As in the experiments
on acute intoxication, the animals were under observation for
some time in the laboratory before the administration of caffein
was begun in order to ascertain the presence or absence of abnormality.
The relation of diet to toxicity received some attention,
but the question was not studied exhaustively in the present investigation.</p>


<h3><a id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_RABBITSs"></a>EXPERIMENTS ON RABBITS.</h3>

<p>Full-grown adult as well as young rabbits were employed. The diet consisted
either of carrots or of oats; water was given ad libitum. The rabbits were kept in
metal cages in a well-lighted and well-ventilated room. Unnecessary handling or
any other procedure tending to fatigue or to cause discomfort to the animals was
very carefully avoided, since we had found that such treatment was likely to decrease
the resistance of the rabbit to caffein. The caffein was administered by feeding by
mouth and through a stomach tube, or by the subcutaneous method. In a good many
cases it was given daily, in some at longer intervals.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series A.</span></p>

<p>The experiments of this series formed a preliminary study for the purpose of testing
the effect of moderate doses. One decigram of caffein per kilo was given daily for
several days; when administered at longer intervals the dose was increased to 150 to
200 mg per kilo. It was found that the smaller doses did not produce any symptoms;
even the weights of the animals were not influenced. Doses of medium size given on
two successive days were likewise without any noticeable effect (Nos. 182, 183, 123,
101). When a third dose of this size was given within 48 or 24 hours it proved fatal
(Nos. 123, 182, and 183). Exceptionally, however, moderately large doses (for rabbits)
may be given for three consecutive days without fatal issue, as in rabbit No. 101.
When given at intervals of two to three days, larger doses, as may be seen from the
protocols, can be administered without causing acute death (Nos. 173, 181, 201).</p>

<p>The results of the tests of this series point to the absence of any accumulation and
to the possible elimination of moderate doses of caffein and its products of decomposition
within 24 hours or thereabouts. When the doses are larger the time of its
elimination is apparently longer, as shown by the fact that repetitions of the dose the
next day may be fatal, but when a longer interval is allowed it may be given without
causing death. It will be observed that only one rabbit of this series survived, but
it was extremely emaciated. This condition has been observed in a number of cases
after caffein had been given for several days. Even when the drug was withdrawn
the animals continued to lose weight. This may be explained by the condition of
the gastro-intestinal canal as found at autopsy. The presence of inflammation of the
mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, with ulceration of the mucous membrane
of the pylorus in one of the rabbits (No. 173) of the series, in all probability
caused diminution or loss of appetite, which of itself would tend to cause loss of flesh
and strength and finally death. Protocols of the experiments follow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>The question whether caffein is cumulative in the rabbit, suggested in the preceding
experiments, was the subject of further investigation in Series B. Caffein was given
by mouth or subcutaneously. Carrots formed the exclusive diet, a measured amount
being given. The rabbits were kept under observation for two weeks, except
Nos. 370 and 373, records of which were made only for four days before the administration
of caffein was begun. Caffein was given by mouth in experiments of Groups I
and III. Rabbits 292, 293, and 295 received daily 20 cc water by mouth for four days
previous to the administration of caffein, while in the rabbits of Group II the caffein
treatment was preceded by the injection of 0.8 per cent salt solution subcutaneously.
The object in both cases was to ascertain whether or not the method of the administration
of caffein has any influence on the animal, but observation made from day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
day failed to show any effect of such treatment. About 1 decigram of caffein per
kilo was administered daily, with occasional intermissions. Later in the course of
the experiment the doses were increased, 0.15 gram per kilo being the maximum dose
given. Rabbit 293 died after the third dose with symptoms of typical caffein poisoning.
The administration of the same dose of caffein was continued 10 days longer in
Nos. 292 and 295. It was omitted on the seventh, fourteenth, and fifteenth days of
the experiment. On the eighteenth day of the experiment the dose was increased to
150 mg per kilo and was repeated 2 days later. No. 295 was found dead the next
day. No. 292 survived. Rabbits 313 and 315 may be considered together, as they
were treated alike in every respect. The initial dose of 100 mg caffein per kilo was
finally increased to 122 mg. After the twelfth dose the emaciation was well marked
and the rabbits were very weak. No. 313 was found dead 2 days, and No. 315
3 days, after the last dose of caffein was given. It should be remarked in this connection
that symptoms of caffein poisoning were never observed in these rabbits.
Death was not due, therefore, primarily to caffein, but the rapid loss of flesh and
strength observed during the last few days suggests that it was due to malnutrition
apparently brought about by caffein.</p>

<p>The results obtained by subcutaneous injection of caffein are given in the table
as Group II. The initial dose of 100 mg per kilo was injected daily. No. 298 died
after the second dose. Nos. 223 and 296 received this amount daily for 6 days.
An intermission of 2 days followed, at the end of which the same dose was given
again. The next day it was increased to 150 mg per kilo, but no effect was observed;
48 hours later this dose was repeated. No. 223 was found dead, but its mate survived.
Symptoms of acute caffein intoxication were not observed in any of these rabbits.
It would seem, therefore, that caffein is not cumulative. This supposition, however,
appears somewhat contradictory in view of the fact that out of the eight rabbits of
this series six died, nor could any cause of death be ascribed other than caffein. Also
the first results of Experiments 293, 370, and 373 might be considered as indicating
that cumulation, though to a moderate extent, does take place, since in these
cases reflexes developed after the drug was given for some time. But this view is
contradicted by the results of Experiment 371, in which 150 mg per kilo given 5
days after the daily dosage of caffein was suspended likewise caused increased reflexes.
Cumulation, therefore, does not account for the effects noted in the other rabbit. It
will be observed that rabbit No. 370, as well as Nos. 371 and 373, had diarrhea for
several days. It is quite possible that the weakened condition rendered the rabbits
more sensitive to the action of the drug. This is made highly probable by the observations
recorded in the experiments on acute intoxication with caffein in which
death occurred after small doses. In such cases some pathological condition was
often disclosed by the autopsy. The results of this series corroborate, therefore, those
of Series A, and indicate again the absence of cumulative action. The results obtained
are in all probability due to malnutrition and other conditions brought about

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series C.</span></p>

<p>The subjects used in these experiments were rabbits of medium size and were apparently
young or at any rate were not very old. The series was planned for the study
of the possible effect of diet on the toxicity of caffein when given for some time, and
therefore oats were substituted for carrots, which had been fed in the previous work, as
already stated. Caffein was given by mouth in the usual way, in 1 per cent solution,
100 mg. per kilo daily. Fourteen rabbits were used for these tests. Their weights were
recorded daily and observations made at frequent intervals during the day.</p>

<p>The only change noticed in all of the experiments of this series was progressive loss
of weight which set in from 3 to 8 days after the administration of the drug was begun.
The duration of life varied considerably. No. 382 died after the first dose. No. 389
lived 2 days, No. 386, 3 days, and No. 385, 5 days; No. 390 lived 7 days and No. 404
lived 20 days after the administration of caffein was begun. The duration of life in all
the others was from 11 to 16 days. The findings at autopsy are interesting and suggestive
as regards the possible explanation of the effects of repeated dosage of caffein. In eight
of the rabbits there was involvement of the mucous membrane of the stomach or intestines
or of both. Since the same condition of the gastro-intestinal canal was observed
in previous experiments with caffein when injected subcutaneously, the mere passing
of the tube into the stomach is obviously not the cause of this condition. The fatal
outcome due is therefore, as was suggested above, to inanition brought about by the
condition of the gastro-intestinal canal. Moreover parallel experiments carried out
on rabbits in the same way with alcohol survived this treatment much longer.
Obviously then the passing of the soft rubber catheter is not the cause of this condition
of the gastro-intestinal canal nor the diet. Rabbits were fed oats exclusively for several
months in this laboratory and thrived. The presence of pneumonia in the other
rabbits of this series may be regarded as accidental, as it is inconceivable that one or
two doses of caffein, as was the case in Nos. 382 and 389, could predispose the lungs to
infection. The results of these experiments therefore are in harmony with those of
the preceding two series, indicating that caffein does not accumulate in the body, and
that the toxicity of caffein, whether of the single dose or of repeated doses is the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
on a diet of carrots or of oats. These results also show that caffein is much more toxic
with repeated dosage. As stated in the historical part of this bulletin the same view
was held by Gourewitch.<a href="#a28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>The evidence brought forth in the preceding pages regarding cumulation of caffein
naturally suggests the question whether or not the body acquires a tolerance for it.
This question has already been answered in the affirmative by Gourewitch,<a href="#a28"><sup>28</sup></a> but
owing to the method he used for the identification of caffein and the few experiments
made his results are not conclusive. The experiments of series A, B, and C might
be regarded as indicating that tolerance for caffein is not acquired by the rabbit. It
was noticed, however, that the rabbit apparently does tolerate increasingly larger
doses under certain conditions, as the following experiments show:</p>

<p><i>Rabbit 223.</i> <i>Belgian hare, male.</i></p>

(258 mg caffein per kilo).</p>

kilo) injected subcutaneously.</p>

<p>November 17: Rabbit still alive; weight, 890 grams.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments indicate that when sufficient time is allowed
between two successive injections, susceptibility to caffein is not increased. The
rabbit, on the contrary, seems to acquire a tolerance for the drug, for the fourth dose
was 15 per cent larger than the minimum fatal dose of caffein. This is in all probability
due to the better elimination of caffein and its products of decomposition and
to recovery from the deleterious effects of each dose, made possible by long intervals
between injections.</p>

<p>The results of these experiments may be briefly summed up by stating that subminimum
doses of caffein given to the rabbit daily or at intervals (not too long) do
not produce any symptoms such as were observed in acute caffein intoxication,
namely, increased reflexes and convulsions, or increased rate of respiration, thus
showing that it is not cumulative. But evidence of undoubted summation of effect
was adduced to show that if the administration of subminimum doses of caffein
be continued daily for a period of 11 to 18 days the result is fatal. Tolerance,
however, may be acquired, although to a limited extent only, provided sufficiently
long intervals between injections are allowed to give time for repair of the injury
done by the drug and to develop a mechanism for its better decomposition and elimination.
Furthermore, the evidence just given indicates that the elimination of subminimum
doses of caffein and its products of decomposition is probably accomplished
within 24 hours or thereabouts. That the elimination of larger doses is not accomplished
in this interval is made probable by the following experiment:</p>

<h3><a id="EXPERIMENTS_ON_DOGSs"></a>EXPERIMENTS ON DOGS.</h3>

<p>Having gained some information respecting the effects of repeated doses of caffein
on rabbits, it was of interest to find out how carnivora reacted to the drug when similarly
administered. A number of dogs were used for the purpose. Considerable
variation in the mode of experimentation, as will appear later, was allowed.</p>

<p>Since the condition of the animal, its age, environment, or diet might be factors
influencing toxicity, tests were made on full-grown and on young growing dogs whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
food was varied. The subjects of the experiment were kept under observation for
a few days to several weeks before the administration of caffein was begun, in order
to determine whether or not any morbid condition existed, as well as to ascertain
whether the new environment had any effect on these animals. Caffein was given
chiefly by mouth, but the subcutaneous method was also employed during a portion
of the experimental period in some dogs. The initial dose, which varied for
different individuals, was maintained for a variable length of time. It was then
progressively increased, in most cases until the death of the animal. With larger
doses the intervals between successive injections were also increased.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series A.</span></p>

<p>Six dogs were used in this series. Caffein was administered by mouth for periods
of six days to five weeks. It was given daily or at intervals of two, and sometimes of
three, days. In a few instances the drug was withheld for four or even for seven
days, and its administration was resumed at the end of this time. The initial dose
in these experiments varied approximately between 40 and 140 mg per kilo. The
doses were then increased gradually, and thus the maximum resistance of the subject
to caffein was tested. The diet consisted either exclusively of meat or largely of
carbohydrates with a minimum amount of meat to give flavor to the food.</p>



<p>
<i>Dog 11. Female.</i></p>

<p>Diet consisted of rice, 250 grams; cane sugar, 250 grams; meat, 50 grams; cracker
meal, about 100 grams. Caffein was given by mouth daily or at intervals of one day,
when the dose did not exceed 1.5 grams. Before the dose was increased to 2 grams, or
approximately 0.213 gram caffein per kilo, an interval of two days was allowed. Symptoms
were noticed the next day. An interval of two days was therefore allowed again
at the end of which the same dose was repeated. It will be remarked that there were
no symptoms this time, and the general condition of the dog seemed to be good. Two
grams of caffein were, therefore, given daily during the next two days without any
untoward effects; the dose was then increased to 2.5 grams. Even after this enormous
quantity no symptoms were observed except slight tremors. When this dose was
repeated 26 hours later, it proved fatal. No albumin or sugar was found in the urine,
although the dog was fed on a very liberal carbohydrate diet. The following is a
complete record of the experiment.</p>

<p>April 20: Urine acid, no albumin, no sugar.</p>

<p>April 21: Urine free from sugar.</p>

<p>May 7: No examination of urine, no symptoms observed; 4 p. m., 2.5 grams
caffein.</p>

<p>May 8: 9 a. m., found dead, urine collected since last dose of caffein was given

<p><i>Dog 28</i>.</p>

<p>April 30: Weight, 6.8 kilos; the diet consisted of 250 grams rice, 250 grams sugar,
100 grams cracker meal, and 100 grams of meat. On May 3 his weight was 7 kilos.
He received 1 gram of caffein by mouth at 12 noon. At 2 p. m. he vomited and
tremors were observed. The next day, May 4, tremors were still present though less
pronounced. Examination of the urine for sugar and albumin was negative; on
May 4, 1 gram caffein was given again and repeated on May 5. On this date his general
condition was not good&mdash;dog had no appetite and refused to take caffein. As the dog
lost 10 per cent of his weight he was put on a meat diet exclusively and the dose of
caffein was reduced to 0.5 gram. He became sick after the second dose, and the
administration of caffein was therefore discontinued. It was resumed after five days
and the caffein was administered in increasing amounts, i. e., on May 18, 0.5 gram;
May 19, 0.5; May 20, 1; May 21, 1 gram in two doses of 0.5 each, given at intervals of
one hour; May 22, 1 gram. Dog became irritable, but no other symptoms were
observed. The administration of caffein was omitted the next day. On the following
day when the same dose of caffein was given there was again marked irritability
and tremors. The experiment was therefore discontinued.</p>



<p><i>Dog 22. Male bulldog.</i></p>

<p>June 24: Dog weighed 13.7 kilos. Diet consisted of meat exclusively; 1 gram

<p>June 28: Dog weighed 13.6 kilos, 1.5 grams caffein given at 10 a. m.</p>

<p>June 30: 1.75 grams caffein administered.</p>

<p>July 2: Dog weighed 13.5 kilos; 2 grams caffein or 0.15 gram per kilo, caused well-marked

<p><i>Dog 20. Female</i>.</p>

<p>May 12: Weight, 7.7 kilos. Fed liberal carbohydrate diet, consisting of rice, 100
grams; sugar 100 grams; meat and cracker meal, a sufficient quantity to flavor the
food.</p>

<p>May 14: Weight, 7.7 kilos. Examination of urine for albumin and sugar gave
negative results. Urine was acid to litmus.</p>

<p>May 17: Weight, 7.4 kilos. Three hours after it was fed the dog received 0.5
gram caffein by mouth. The test of the urine the next day for sugar was negative,
but a trace of albumin was present. It will be noticed that the doses were increased
gradually and that symptoms were observed only after the fourth dose of 0.1 gram
per kilo. Later meat was substituted for the carbohydrate diet and the administration
of caffein was stopped for four days. At the end of this period 100 mg caffein
per kilo was fed daily for five days, and the dose was then very gradually increased.
Diarrhea occurred twice, but no other symptoms, the second attack having lasted
a few days. The following is a complete record of the experiment:</p>

<p><i>Dog 19.</i> <i>Female fox terrier.</i></p>

<p>May 13: Weight 6.4 kilos. Diet consisted of rice, 100 grams; sugar, 100 grams; and
a sufficient quantity of meat and cracker meal to give flavor to the food. Examination
of the urine showed a trace of albumin but no sugar. The urine was acid to litmus.
Two days later the urine was alkaline to litmus. There was still a small amount of
albumin but no sugar.</p>

<p>May 17: 0.5 gram caffein was given by mouth. Examination of the urine collected
the next day still showed the presence of albumin and the absence of reducing substances.
The dog had tremors. Caffein was, therefore, not administered.</p>

<p>May 19: 0.5 gram caffein was given by mouth.</p>

<p>May 20: 0.75 gram caffein was fed at 12.45 p. m. The dog vomited during the night
and tremors were observed the next morning. The urine collected was examined
for albumin and sugar, but neither was found.</p>

<p>May 21: 12 noon, 0.75 gram caffein was fed. The dog weighed 6 kilos, which therefore
represented a loss of 0.4 kilo. Grew abnormally thirsty and lost appetite, but
no other symptoms of caffein poisoning were observed.</p>

<p>May 22: The dog was again given 0.75 gram caffein at 12 noon. The examination
of the urine for albumin and sugar gave negative results. The dog died at 4.15 p. m.
The fatal dose for this dog was therefore 0.125 gram caffein per kilo, and the total
amount of caffein ingested in six days amounted to 3.25 grams, or 0.54 gram per day,
which makes 90 mg per kilo.</p>

then increased and were given at longer intervals. No symptoms of the effects of
caffein were observed until a dose of 1.5 gram was fed, when diarrhea was noticed on
the next day. In the following record the details of the experiment are given:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>



<p>July 2: 11.30 a. m., 2.0 gram caffein fed by mouth; 1.30 p. m., tetanus, dog died.
The total amount of caffein fed to dog No. 21 out of the 25 days of the experiment was
14.45 grams, or an average of 578 mg per day, which amounts to about 42 to 43 mg per
kilo of body weight.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the diversity in the method of experimentation, there was a
striking uniformity in some of the results obtained. All the experiments of the series
showed absence of cumulative action of caffein. The experimental evidence presented
indicates that moderately large doses may be given at intervals of about 24
hours without inducing any symptoms of nervous or any other disturbance. This is
illustrated in the tests on dog 11, which were preliminary in character. In this subject
100 to 150 mg of caffein per kilo were ingested daily for several days without
showing any changes. Later in the course of the experiment, after larger doses were
given, mild symptoms only, such as tremors, were observed. Additional evidence of
the absence of cumulative action of caffein was furnished by the results of the following
experiments:</p>

<p>Dog 23 received 142 mg of caffein per kilo on three successive days. His general
condition indicated that these amounts of caffein were toxic, but he survived. In
another series of tests, made after he was allowed to rest a few days, he again failed to
show any cumulation of the drug, as he survived this time a series of tests of longer
duration than the first.</p>

<p>A much better illustration of the absence of cumulative action of the drug is furnished
by the experiments on dog No. 20. In this case 100 to 125 mg of caffein per
kilo, given on 10 consecutive days, did not cause any marked effects. Diarrhea and
restlessness were the only symptoms observed. These experiments therefore show
that the elimination and decomposition of caffein are apparently effected by the body
within twenty-four hours or thereabouts.</p>

<p>Experiments on dog 19, however, form an exception&mdash;the third dose of 125 mg caffein
per kilo having proved fatal. The very low protein content of the diet of this
dog suggests itself as a possible cause of the lower resistance to caffein of this subject.
But it may be observed that the same diet was furnished to dog 20, which stood such
amounts of caffein much longer. The presence of a trace of albumin in the urine of
dog 19 is likewise inadmissible as a cause of the difference in the toxicity of caffein
in this dog, for the urine of dog 20 likewise contained a trace of albumin. The alkaline
reaction of the urine, together with the fact that the first dose of only 60 mg of caffein
per kilo induced symptoms of toxicity, suggests the presence of an abnormal condition
which in all probability was the cause of the death of this subject under the conditions
indicated.</p>

<p>In a large number of experiments on caffein performed in this laboratory it has been
observed that symptoms due to caffein often disappeared when the administration of
the same dose of the drug was continued. Thus dog 19 vomited when the amount of
caffein was increased to 125 mg per kilo. When this amount was repeated the next
day there was no vomiting. Similar observations were made on dogs 11 and 23, also
on other dogs. No. 22 developed diarrhea at first; when the administration of caffein
was resumed several days later, however, there was no diarrhea. In other experiments
performed in this laboratory, symptoms of nervous irritability induced by
caffein disappeared on continued treatment.</p>

<p>It was interesting, therefore, to inquire whether resistance to caffein would be
increased by the continued administration of progressively larger amounts of the drug.
When doses of 150 and over were fed, the intervals allowed were usually longer than
24 hours. Two and sometimes three days were permitted to elapse between two successive
doses. This was done in order to allow time for recovery from possible changes
induced by larger doses of caffein, and thus prevent the summation of effect. In the
experiments considered, therefore, Nos. 11, 23, 20, and 19, the toxicity of caffein does
not seem to be greater than in the experiments on acute caffein intoxication in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
dog. It was thought, however, that the large initial doses or the quick change to large
doses when the amounts used in the beginning were small, might have something to
do with failure to induce a marked degree of tolerance. The experiment on dog 21
was therefore carried out by giving from 40 to 60 mg per kilo for eight days, and then
increasing the dose, but tolerance could not be induced, as is shown in the protocol
to the experiment.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series B.</span></p>

<p>According to the studies of Chittenden,<a href="#a16"><sup>16</sup></a> low protein diet improves the general
metabolism of the body, fatigue is diminished, and bodily vigor, therefore, correspondingly
increased. The expectation is, therefore, justified that the defense of the
organism against deleterious substances introduced into the body is much improved
by such a diet, thus increasing its resistance to poisons. Hunt's experiment on this
subject, also quoted by Chittenden, lends support to this view. He found that mice
fed on carbohydrates chiefly, or on foods containing only a small amount of protein,
were more resistant to acetonitril. It was interesting, therefore, to inquire whether
the toxicity of caffein differs under similar conditions of diet.</p>

<p>A fixed diet of the same calorific value was provided for all dogs of this series, but
the protein content for three of the animals was approximately one-third of the amount
usually fed to dogs. Caffein was at first administered subcutaneously, but all the dogs
on a low protein diet developed abscesses at the site of injection, while none of those
on high protein diet showed a local reaction. Feeding by mouth was then begun
and continued throughout the experiment in each case. The initial dose was 50 mg
per kilo, which was given daily for seven to nine days. It was then increased progressively
by 25 mg per kilo; 75 mg per kilo were administered for one to two days,
100 mg for two to three days, 125 mg for one to two days, 150 mg for one to two days,
and a single dose of 175 mg. It will be remarked that sometimes an interval of one
day had to be allowed during which no caffein was fed.</p>



<p>
<i>Dog 30. Black and tan hound, male.</i></p>

<p>The dog was under observation for about eight weeks before the experiment was
begun and had received a high protein diet. He was then given 50 mg caffein for nine
consecutive days. On the tenth day the dose was increased to 75 mg per kilo. As no
symptoms developed, this dose was increased to 100 mg per kilo, and was fed one day
apart. It was then raised to 125 mg per kilo. For the first time since the drug was
fed, symptoms appeared; they were noticed a few hours after feeding and persisted
during the next day. Although the appetite was good, no caffein was given on this
day. On the following day this dose was repeated. As the symptoms were not serious,
150 mg per kilo were given daily for the next three days, until 175 mg per kilo was
reached. This dose proved fatal within six hours. Record of experiment follows:</p>

<p>October 9: Weight, 9 kilos, on full nitrogen diet, received daily 0.724 gram nitrogen
per kilo or 87 calories per kilo, received 18 grams meat per kilo, 4 grams lard per kilo,
3 grams carbohydrates per kilo, bone dust, ad libitum.</p>

<p>November 3: Weight, 9.10 kilos.</p>

<p>November 10: Weight, 9 kilos.</p>

<p>November 20: Weight, 9.55 kilos.</p>

<p>November 29: Weight, 8.70 kilos.</p>

<p>December 6, 7, 8, and 9: Received subcutaneously 22 cc 2 per cent caffein. Condition
good, site of injection normal.</p>

<p>December 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14: Received 0.4375 gram caffein by mouth equal to
0.050 gram per kilo, no symptoms, appetite and general condition good.</p>

<p>December 15: 11.30 a. m., received 0.6563 gram caffein by mouth, or 0.75 gram per
kilo, no symptoms, appetite good, condition excellent.</p>

<p>December 16: 11 a. m., received 0.870 gram caffein by mouth, or 0.1 gram per kilo,
weight 8.70 kilos, no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 17: No caffein given.</p>

<p>December 18: Received 0.870 gram caffein, or 0.1 gram per kilo, no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 20: 2.45 p. m., received 1.0875 grams caffein, or 0.125 per kilo; 4 p. m.,
ate food readily, seemed very uncomfortable and sick.</p>

<p>December 21: 9 a. m., stiffness in muscles, but no other symptoms, appetite good,
no caffein given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>December 22: 11 a. m., received 1.0875 grams caffein, or 0.125 gram per kilo; 3 p. m.,
depressed in spirits and sick, but no other symptoms observed.</p>

<p>December 23: 11.30 a. m., received 1.305 grams caffein, or 0.150 gram caffein per
kilo; 1.30 p. m., apparently quite sick, but no other symptoms, had good appetite.</p>

<p>December 24: 10 a. m., received 0.175 gram caffein per kilo; 4 p. m., when about
to be fed fell over and died; no autopsy.</p>

<p>The total amount of caffein given dog 30 was 11.3458 grams, administered for a period
of eighteen days. The average daily amount per kilo was therefore 72 mg. The feces
became offensive when the amounts of caffein were increased to 75 mg per kilo. It
will be observed that in this dog the appetite was uniformly good until the day of his
death. Whether or not this is the cause of his resistance to caffein will be discussed
later.</p>



<p><i>Dog 32. White, male, young.</i></p>

<p>Although he was growing rapidly this dog's weight was constant, but he looked
anemic. He received a high protein diet until December 3, when the rations were
increased by one-third. This dog was under observation from October 26 to December
6 when the administration of caffein was begun. He then received 50 mg caffein
per kilo daily for nine days consecutively without showing any effects, when the
dose was increased to 75 mg per kilo, then to 100 mg per kilo. This dose was further
increased to 150 mg per kilo without causing symptoms, which was repeated the
next day. No symptoms having been observed after such amounts of caffein, 175 mg
per kilo were fed. This dose, however, proved fatal within two hours. Record of
experiment follows:</p>

<p>October 26: Weight, 6.90 kilos.</p>

<p>November 3: Weight, 6.90 kilos.</p>

<p>November 10: Weight, 6.90 kilos.</p>

<p>November 20: Weight, 6.90 kilos.</p>

<p>November 29: Weight, 6.55 kilos.</p>

<p>December 3: Put into cage, diet increased one-third.</p>

<p>December 6, 7, 8, 9: Weight 6.30 kilos; 12.30 p. m., received 16 cc 2 per cent caffein
by subcutaneous injection in back, no symptoms of any kind noticed, site of injection
normal.</p>

<p>December 10, 14: 0.05 gram caffein per kilo.</p>

<p>December 15: Received 0.4725 gram caffein by mouth, no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 16: Received 0.655 gram caffein, 0.100 gram per kilo.</p>

<p>December 17: No caffein given.</p>

<p>December 18: Received 0.655 gram caffein daily, 0.100 gram per kilo, no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 20: Received 0.8188 gram caffein, 0.125 gram per kilo, no symptoms,
appetite good.</p>

<p>December 21: Received 0.9825 gram caffein, 0.150 gram per kilo, somewhat uncomfortable,
no other symptoms.</p>

<p>December 22: Received 0.9825 gram caffein, 0.150 gram per kilo, no symptoms
except some uneasiness.</p>

<p>December 23: 9 a. m., no symptoms, appetite good; 11.30 a. m., received 1.146 grams
caffein, 0.1759 gram per kilo; 1.30 p. m., died while making an effort to get out of cage,
tonic contraction of limbs observed before death.</p>

<p>The amount of caffein received during the entire experimental period was 9.2223
grams, or an average per day approximately of 80 mg per kilo, and therefore 10 per cent
more than dog No. 30 received. It will be observed that the appetite in dog No. 32
was likewise uniformly good, and that he received a very high protein diet which was
also of a very high calorific value.</p>

<p><i>Autopsy (dog 32).</i>&mdash;Stomach presented a severe inflammation of the mucosa, especially
in the fundus and pyloric portions. The gastritis was more marked in pyloric
portion, and the inflammatory condition extended along the whole course of small
intestines, which presented numerous hemorrhagic areas, and a thick catarrhal exudate
on the mucosa. The large intestine contained quite a large number of parasites,
probably round worms. The liver was enlarged and the gall cyst well filled. The
spleen was also considerably engorged, kidneys appeared normal, other organs all
appeared normal.</p>



<p><i>Dog 31. Black spaniel, male.</i></p>

<p>This dog had been under observation one month previous to the experiments with
caffein. The usual initial dose was then administered for nine days. There were no
signs of local irritation when the drug was given subcutaneously, but symptoms of
toxicity were present. These disappeared, however, when the drug was administered
by mouth. The dose was therefore increased to 75 mg per kilo. This, as will be seen,
proved fatal within six hours. High nitrogen diet, same as No. 30.</p>

<p>November 3: Weight 10.250 kilos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>November 10: Weight, 10.25 kilos.</p>

<p>November 20: Weight, 10.30 kilos.</p>

<p>December 1: Put in cage.</p>

<p>December 6, 7, 8, 9: Weight, 10.20 kilos; received 26 cc 2 per cent caffein subcutaneously,
site of injection normal.</p>

<p>December 6: Very restless and excited, whined when handled as though muscles
were sore, appeared to be sick.</p>

<p>December 10-14: Condition good, received 0.51 gram caffein by mouth daily, no
noteworthy symptoms, appetite continues good, somewhat restless at intervals.</p>

<p>December 15: 11.30 a. m., received 0.765 gram caffein per mouth (0.075 gram per
kilo); 2 p. m., depressed in spirit, seemed sick and uncomfortable; 4.15 p. m., when
about to feed, animal jumped up, then fell back dead.</p>

<p><i>Autopsy (dog 31)</i>: Lungs congested; heart filled with blood and contained small
amount of blood-stained fluid in pericardial sac. Liver deeply congested, soft and
friable; gall bladder distended with bile; kidneys showed inflammation of cortex;
spleen pale, normal in size and consistency; stomach practically empty, the mucosa of
the pyloric portion exhibited severe gastritis, with thick catarrhal exudate. This
catarrhal inflammation extended through the duodenum; remaining portion of small
intestine showed mild inflammation; large intestine appeared practically normal.
The total amount of caffein received by dog 31 during 10 days was 5.395 mg, or a daily
average of 53.9 mg per kilo. This unusually low resistance to caffein (which was
practically the only case in all the experiments on dogs presented in this research)
suggests the presence of some abnormal condition. The bloody exudate in the pericardial
cavity indicating pericarditis, which is likely to induce secondary changes of
cardiac muscle, may be considered as a possible cause of the increased toxicity of
caffein in this case.</p>



<p><i>Dog 29. Male fox terrier, black.</i></p>

<p>This dog was kept on a low nitrogen diet for nearly five weeks before the feeding of
caffein was begun. The administration of 50 mg of caffein per kilo was then carried
on for eight days without showing any symptoms of toxicity. The usual increase of
dose was then given&mdash;75 mg per kilo&mdash;which was followed by a manifestation of
symptoms. Further increase, however, to 100 mg per kilo had no visible effect.
Nevertheless it was considered advisable to suspend the feeding of caffein for one day.
The same amounts were then repeated on two consecutive days. No symptoms having
been observed, 125 mg per kilo were given. As symptoms of toxicity and especially
loss of appetite were observed, the dog was not given any caffein the next day. Since
his appetite had now improved, the experiment with larger doses was resumed. Death
followed after the second dose of 150 mg per kilo. Protocol follows:</p>

<p>Weight, 9.90 kilos. One-third nitrogen diet. Receives 0.269 gram nitrogen per
kilo (88.269 calories per kilo).</p>

<p>December 23: 9 a. m., showed no symptoms from the day before, ate food gradually,
seemed sick; 11.30 a. m., received 1.425 grams caffein (0.150 gram per kilo); 1.30<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
p. m., looked and behaved as if very sick, no other symptoms; 3.45 p. m., in attempting
to get out of box fell over on back, had convulsions, whined, dyspn&oelig;a, died within 30
seconds.</p>

<p><i>Autopsy</i>: Stomach exhibited mild inflammation; small intestine inflamed and hemorrhagic
areas on mucosa; liver engorged and friable; spleen normal; kidneys slightly
congested; other organs appeared normal. The total amount of caffein fed to Dog 29
was 12.135 grams, which was given in 18 days. The average daily amount per kilo
was therefore 67.68 mg.</p>



<p><i>Dog 28. Male fox terrier.</i></p>

<p>Low nitrogen diet was begun about four weeks before the feeding of caffein; 50 mg
of caffein was then fed for seven consecutive days. Partial loss of appetite was
observed after the first dose. As the experiment progressed the desire for food steadily
diminished, and the feces became fetid. Symptoms of intoxication manifested themselves
early in the experiment, and vomiting occurred after the fourth dose. The
dog was then put on a diet exclusively of meat. After an intermission of 10 days 109
mg caffein per kilo were given. Since there were no symptoms, the following day the
amount was increased to 125 mg per kilo. This dose proved fatal within 16 to 20 hours.</p>

<p>This dog was stout and strong, weight 12.25 kilos, received daily 0.269 gram nitrogen
per kilo (88.269 calories per kilo).</p>

<p>November 3: Weight, 11.75 kilos.</p>

<p>November 10: Weight, 11.95 kilos.</p>

<p>November 20: Weight, 11.20 kilos. All through this period had been kept in a cold,
poorly ventilated room, put in a warm room, with bedding and good ventilation.</p>

<p>November 29: Weight, 11.95 kilos.</p>

<p>December 1: Put in a cage; weight, 11.95 kilos.</p>

<p>December 6: Weight, 11.95 kilos; 11.45 a. m., received 0.050 gram caffein per kilo;
then received 30 cc 2 per cent caffein (0.6 gram) in practically one subcutaneous injection;
4.30 p. m., ate only part of food.</p>

<p>December 7: 10.25 a. m., received 30 cc 2 per cent caffein by subcutaneous injection
(0.6 gram, or 50 mg, per kilo); 1.45 p. m., seemed sensitive to touch, no desire for
food, depressed in spirit.</p>

<p>December 8: 11.40 a. m., received 30 cc 2 per cent caffein by subcutaneous injection
(50 mg per kilo); 1 p. m., depressed in spirit, hind legs seemed somewhat stiff,
no desire for regular food, site of injection inflamed.</p>

<p>December 9: 10.50 a. m., received 30 cc 2 per cent caffein by subcutaneous injection
(50 mg per kilo); 2.30 p. m., had vomited, no desire for regular food.</p>

<p>December 10: Inflammation of site of injection, and swelling very pronounced;
2 p. m., received 0.5975 gram caffein, or 50 mg per kilo, with 30 grams of meat, refused
regular food.</p>

<p>December 11, 12: Received 0.5975 gram caffein by mouth, no symptoms except
refusal of regular food, feces fetid.</p>

<p>December 13-22: Put on meat diet exclusively, high temperature, no caffein,
weight 10 kilos, appetite good, feces fetid.</p>

<p>December 22: 12 a. m., weight 11 kilos, received 1.2 grams caffein by mouth (0.109
gram per kilo); 4 p. m., no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 23: 11.30 a. m., received 1.375 grams caffein (0.125 gram per kilo) had
vomited food of the day before, but could notice no caffein or capsules in vomit; 4.30
p. m., no symptoms, seemed in good spirits, appetite good, had no meat to feed with, so
was given low nitrogen feed, of which he ate about one-fourth.</p>

<p>December 24: 9 a. m., found dead, stiff, and cold. The most striking effect of caffein
in this dog is the increased intestinal putrefaction. The feces were still fetid 10 days
after the administration of caffein was stopped.</p>

<p><i>Autopsy, dog 28</i>: Stomach partially filled with an undigested food mass; mucosa
showed severe inflammation; small intestines presented a hemorrhagic enteritis along
whole extent; large intestine also exhibited mild inflammation; liver was engorged;
spleen appeared normal; kidneys slightly congested in cortical portion; other organs
appeared normal.</p>

<p><i>Dog 24. White and tan male</i>: Was put on low protein diet six weeks before experiments
with caffein were begun. The initial dose of 50 mg per kilo was then administered
on eight consecutive days. The only symptoms observed during this period
of caffein administration were those of intestinal putrefaction. Fetid feces were
noticed already after the first dose of caffein was injected. When the second dose
of 75 mg of caffein was repeated, mild symptoms appeared, but none have been
observed even with increased amounts of caffein.</p>

<p>One-third nitrogen diet. Received daily 0.269 gram nitrogen per kilo (88.269
calories per kilo).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>October 26: Weight 11.15 kilos. Food consisted of 5 grams cracker meal per kilo;
meat, 3 grams per kilo; lard, 2 grams per kilo; tapioca, 10.69 grams per kilo. Kept in
a cold, damp room with poor ventilation until November 20.</p>

<p>November 3: Weight, 11 kilos.</p>

<p>November 10: Weight, 10.75 kilos.</p>

<p>November 20: Weight, 10.55 kilos; changed to a warm room, with bedding and good
ventilation.</p>

<p>November 29: Weight, 10.85 kilos.</p>

<p>December 1: Put into a cage.</p>

<p>December 6: Weight, 10.90 kilos; 11.25 a. m., received 28 cc 2 per cent caffein subcutaneously
in side, below the shoulders, area washed with alcohol and ether,
approximately 50 mg per kilo administered, no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 7: 10.15 a. m., received 28 cc 2 per cent caffein injected subcutaneously;
feces soft and very fetid; 1 p. m., depressed in spirit, eyes dull.</p>

<p>December 9: 10.45 a. m., received 25 cc 2 per cent caffein solution subcutaneously,
feces still fetid, site of injection inflamed and swollen, no other symptoms.</p>

<p>December 10: Inflammation of area of injection more pronounced; 2 p. m., given
0.5449 gram caffein and 30 grams of meat; 4 p. m., fed, no symptoms, feces fetid.</p>

<p>December 11: 12 a. m., given 0.5459 gram caffein and 30 grams of meat, no symptoms,
feces fetid.</p>

<p>December 12, 13: Given 0.5459 gram caffein daily, without noticing any symptoms.</p>

<p>December 14: 12 a. m., received 0.817 gram caffein (75 mg per kilo); 2.30 p. m., restless
and uncomfortable, no other symptoms.</p>

<p>December 15: 11.30 a. m., received 0.8175 gram caffein by mouth; 2 p. m., depressed
in spirit, acted as though sick, no other symptoms.</p>

<p>December 16: Weight, 11 kilos; 11 a. m., received 0.100 gram caffein per kilo (1.100
grams) by mouth, no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 17: Rested.</p>

<p>December 18: 2.30 p. m., received 1.100 grams caffein by mouth; 4 p. m., no
symptoms.</p>

<p>December 19: 12 noon, received 1.100 grams caffein by mouth; 4.15 p. m., no
symptoms.</p>

<p>December 20: 2.45 p. m., given 1.375 grams caffein (0.125 gram per kilo); 3.45 p. m.,
vomited&mdash;one of the capsules being found intact, the other broken open; 4 p. m.,
given regular diet, containing 1.3757 grams caffein in capsules, ate most of this during
the night, whined at intervals, coordination disturbed, appeared very sick, but
exhibited no other symptoms.</p>

<p>December 21: 9 a. m., found dead, stiff, and cold.</p>

<p>The total amount of caffein received by dog 24 was between 10.109 and 11.484 grams.
As one of the capsules vomited was intact and the other broken open, the amount was
probably about 10.75 grams. The fatal dose in this case was undoubtedly less than
185 mg per kilo&mdash;somewhere between 125 and 185 mg. Autopsy showed heart in
diastole; posterior lobe of right lung deeply congested; liver engorged; gall cyst filled;
spleen appeared normal; stomach well filled with semifluid mass; pyloric portion of
stomach exhibited a severe inflammation of mucosa; mucosa of duodenum greatly
inflamed and showed hemorrhagic areas and catarrhal exudate; remainder of small
intestine also exhibited mild inflammation; kidneys deeply engorged, mesentery
injected.</p>

<p>A comparison of the fatal doses of caffein in the experiments on high and low protein
diet does not show much difference in the resistance to caffein, since 175 mg per kilo
proved fatal to Nos. 30 and 32, while No. 29 died after receiving 150 mg per kilo, and
No. 24 received 125 to 185 mg per kilo. Moreover, No. 28, which was changed from
low to high protein diet, succumbed when given 125 mg per kilo. Observations made
during the experimental period indicate, however, greater toxicity of caffein in the
subjects on low protein diet. Dog 30 showed the effects of the drug when the
dose was increased to 125 mg of caffein per kilo, while in No. 32, 150 mg per kilo were
received without any manifestation of symptoms. Dog 31, which was likewise on a
high protein diet, is evidently an exception, and its low resistance to caffein may be
accounted for by the condition found at autopsy. In other dogs on low protein diet
symptoms of intoxication appeared early in the experiment. In Nos. 29 and 24 it
was observed as soon as the amount of caffein was increased to 75 mg per kilo. In
dog 28 the first dose of caffein 50 mg per kilo was toxic. The symptoms of gastro-intestinal
disturbance were especially marked after caffein on low protein diet. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
may seem to contradict the results of experiments on dogs 11 and 20, in which larger
doses of caffein failed to induce symptoms of intoxication. But it should be observed
that the diet, which consisted almost exclusively of carbohydrates, was given only
during the administration of caffein, while in the experiments of series B the subjects
received a low protein diet for several weeks before the administration of caffein
was begun, and it was continued through the entire caffein period. It will be remarked
that the absence of cumulative action in the experiments of the preceding
series was also observed in dogs on high as well as on low protein diet. The appearance
of symptoms after smaller doses of caffein in the latter experiments might suggest
cumulative action, but since these symptoms disappeared on continued administration
of the substance cumulation is clearly not indicated. The gastrointestinal lesions
observed on post-mortem examination were, it will be recalled, also found in rabbits
similarly treated. The explanation suggested probably applies also in the case of
dogs.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Series C.</span></p>

<p>As already pointed out in the experiments on acute toxicity of caffein, young growing
dogs are probably more resistant to caffein than adults. That this may also hold true
in chronic caffein intoxication seemed indicated by the following experiments.</p>



<p>
<i>Dog 33. Black female puppy. Weight, 4 kilos. Had been continuously on a meat
diet.</i></p>

<p>December 22: 2.30 p. m., received 0.69 gram of caffein (0.172 gram per kilo); 3.15
p. m., no symptoms except that feces were fetid.</p>

<p>December 23: 11.30 a. m., received 0.79 gram of caffein (0.197 gram per kilo); 1.30
p. m., no symptoms.</p>

<p>December 24: 11 a. m., received 0.87 gram of caffein (0.2009 gram per kilo); 4 p. m.,
no symptoms.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the only effect produced in dog 33 by feeding caffein was
increased intestinal putrefaction, although 2.37 grams of caffein were given in three
days. Additional data on the effects of the age of animals on the resistance to caffein
seemed desirable. The following experiments were therefore carried out. Six puppies
of the same litter were weaned when 7 to 8 weeks old and put on a milk diet. Three
of them received this diet throughout the experimental period. Meat was substituted
in the other three a few days before the administration of caffein was begun, and was
continued until the end of the experiment. Caffein was given by mouth; the initial
dose, which was administered for several days and then gradually increased, being
160 to 200 mg for each dog, except one, which received only 100 mg per kilo for several
days and then an increased amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>An intermission of a few days (during which no caffein was given) was allowed.
This was done on account of some studies carried on at the same time on the effect of
caffein on certain constituents of the urine.</p>

<p>Highest amount of caffein given, 362 mg per kilo. No autopsy.</p>

<p>Examination of the results obtained in the experiments of series C shows that
young and growing dogs tolerate large amounts of caffein. In four subjects of this
series, Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 6, no effect was observed when moderately large amounts
(160 to 200 mg per kilo of caffein) were fed. Symptoms were noticed only when
these amounts of caffein were increased from 50 to 60 per cent. The other two dogs,
Nos. 4 and 5, of this series were less resistant, however, to caffein, as 0.16 gram of the
drug per kilo induced well-marked symptoms. Since these were fed meat, while Nos.
1, 2, and 3 received milk, the difference in toxicity may be due to the diet employed,
but No. 6, which likewise received a meat diet, failed to show the effects of caffein
when 200 mg per kilo were fed. On the other hand, it should be noticed that No. 1
died after receiving 360 mg per kilo, No. 2 survived a dose of 334 mg, while No. 3 died
after a dose of 322 mg per kilo of caffein. The fatal doses for Nos. 4, 5, and 6 were 287,
335, and 300 mg per kilo, respectively. Although the differences are too small to
justify any definite conclusion regarding the effect of a milk diet or of a meat diet on
the toxicity of caffein, the results nevertheless suggest a reasonable possibility that
caffein is more toxic to young dogs when on an exclusively meat diet than when fed
milk. It is perfectly evident, however, that the resistance to caffein in either case is
very great, almost twice that of adult subjects. As shown in series A and B, 125 to
175 mg per kilo proved fatal to all but two animals in these experiments, while
symptoms of toxicity appeared after much smaller doses. In other respects the
behavior of young dogs toward caffein was the same as that of the adult. In neither
case was cumulation nor tolerance observed under the conditions of these experiments.
The findings at autopsy were likewise similar, as gastro-enteritis was the
chief lesion observed on macroscopic examination. It might be mentioned, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
in this connection, that the symptoms of caffein intoxication in young dogs often
presented marked differences from those observed in those of more advanced age.
The resemblance of the effects of caffein in young puppies and in rabbits was very
striking. In both, the tonic with clonic convulsions were observed after a sufficient
quantity of caffein was administered. In the dogs which were fully grown a large
dose of caffein was usually followed by tonic convulsions and almost instantaneous
death.</p>

<p>Moderately large amounts of caffein fed daily to puppies for several days&mdash;in some
cases as long as 10 days&mdash;induced mild symptoms only. No cumulative effect was
observed in any of the experiments of series C. There seems to be tolerance of certain
functions toward caffein, but no general tolerance of the body could be obtained in
these experiments. Caffein is apparently less toxic for adult dogs on high than on low
protein diet. In young and growing dogs caffein is somewhat less toxic when milk,
rather than meat, forms the exclusive diet. Some pathological conditions apparently
increase the toxicity of caffein also in dogs. The symptoms of caffein intoxication
observed in young dogs are in some respects different from those in full grown and older
animals, and resemble those noticed in rabbits.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="DISCUSSION_OF_RESULTS" id="DISCUSSION_OF_RESULTS">DISCUSSION OF RESULTS.</a></h2>


<p>It was pointed out at some length in the introduction that the
toxicity of some drugs may not be the same for all forms of life.
This observation was also made by some investigators who experimented
with caffein on different species of animals. Thus Maurel<a href="#a55"><sup>55</sup></a>
stated that caffein is twice as toxic for the frog as for the rabbit when
administered by mouth. Fröhner's<a href="#a26"><sup>26</sup></a> experiments, on the other hand,
made on domestic animals, failed to show great differences in the
toxicity of caffein. According to this observer, horses seem to be
more susceptible than cattle, goats, and swine, the minimum toxic
dose being the same for all of these, while the resistance of the dog to
caffein is about midway between that of the horse and the other
animals mentioned. It may be remarked, however, that Fröhner made
only 13 experiments. That these data are inadequate for the formation
of any conclusions as to the toxicity of caffein is evident since
the most striking effect of caffein observed in the work herein
reported was the comparatively wide range of variation in the resistance
of individuals of the same species to this drug. This was
found to be the case even when the conditions of experimentation
were approximately uniform, and was observed whatever the mode
of administration of the drug employed. The toxicity for different
individuals also varied in acute as well as in chronic intoxication.
It is for this reason that the number of tests employed were often
quite large, for no conclusions of any value could be drawn without
averaging the results of a sufficiently large number of experiments.
Furthermore, it is to be borne in mind that the action of a drug may
differ according to the mode of its introduction into the body and
that different species of animals may vary in this regard. This is
especially true of some substances when given by mouth, the range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in toxicity for certain species of animals being much greater when
thus administered than when injected subcutaneously or intravenously.</p>

<p>Maurel's<a href="#a56"><sup>56</sup></a> investigations are of interest in this connection, as his
work embraces a systematic study of the toxicity of a large number
of substances in the rabbit, pigeon, and frog when given by mouth,
subcutaneously, intravenously, or when injected into the muscles.
According to this investigator the range of variation of the toxicity
of a substance is widest when given by mouth. Potassium sulphocyanid,
for example, is about 2.5 times as toxic for the frog as for the
rabbit when given by mouth. Quinin hydrobromid is three times as
toxic for the frog as for the pigeon, while for the rabbit it is twice as
toxic as for the pigeon. When given by hypodermic injection the
toxic dose per kilo weight is practically the same for all three species.
The difference of resistance according to the mode of administration
is even more marked for spartein sulphate. When given by mouth
the toxicity for the rabbit is six times as great as for the frog, but
when injected subcutaneously the toxic dose is about the same for
the rabbit and for the frog. The relation of the mode of administration
to toxicity is further shown in the following substances: For
the rabbit the minimum fatal dose per kilo of quinin hydrobromid is
1.5 grams administered by mouth, 0.5 gram when injected subcutaneously,
and 0.07 gram by the intravenous path, while strychnin
sulphate is twice as toxic administered intravenously as subcutaneously,
and six times as toxic as when administered by mouth.
The mode of introduction, however, does not always affect the
toxicity of a substance. This is made evident by the action of
strychnin on frogs in which, according to Maurel<a href="#a56"><sup>56</sup></a>, the toxic dose is
the same whether given by mouth or injected into the subcutaneous
tissues. This appears to hold true also for other animals as demonstrated
by the experiments of Hatcher<a href="#a35"><sup>35</sup></a> on the cat, in which he
observed that strychnin is as readily absorbed from a full stomach
as from the subcutaneous tissues. These findings are extremely
interesting, especially in view of Maurel's<a href="#a57"><sup>57</sup></a> work on the subject,
according to which he finds that a substance is much less toxic when
given by mouth than when administered by hypodermic injection
or intravenously. That this generalization does not admit, however,
of universal application is made evident by the work of various
experimenters. Claude Bernard<a href="#a10"><sup>10</sup></a> observed that curara is as poisonous
for the pigeon when given by mouth as when injected subcutaneously,
while Zalesky<a href="#a86"><sup>86</sup></a> found that samandarin is more toxic for frogs when
introduced into the stomach than by injection into the lymph sacs.
Our experiments with caffein likewise show that Maurel's generalization
does not always hold good, since it was found in experiments with
gray rabbits that the minimum fatal dose is but moderately greater
by mouth than by the subcutaneous path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Equally interesting is the observation of the writer, that in the
guinea pig the difference in the toxicity between the subcutaneous
and intraperitoneal injections is very slight, while in the cat the
toxicity of caffein is the same whether given by mouth or injected
into the subcutaneous tissues, and is markedly less when injected into
the peritoneal cavity. The experiments on dogs show considerable
variation of effective dose when given by mouth, but the interesting
observation was made that the toxic dose by mouth may be
smaller in some cases than the average dose by subcutaneous injection.
If the resistance to caffein by subcutaneous injection of the
different species of animals experimented upon in the present research
be compared, it will be noticed that the gray rabbit or Belgian hare,
which is more resistant than the other varieties employed, stands
more caffein in proportion to the weight of the body than the other
animals.</p>

<p>Although the minimum fatal dose was found to be somewhat larger
for the guinea pig than for the gray rabbit when caffein was injected
intraperitoneally, it was on the contrary smaller by other paths of
introduction, and approximated quite closely the minimum fatal
dose for rabbits of the other varieties. Cats as well as dogs were
found to be distinctly less resistant to caffein than the herbivora.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors far more important than zoological
differences which influence the toxicity of caffein. Some of these
are age, season, and pathologic conditions. As these factors have
already been dwelt upon in their appropriate places, further discussion
might seem unnecessary, but owing to their importance in determining
the action of a drug, emphasis is desirable. Especially is this
the case with pathological conditions in relation to toxicity. While
no positive proof of diminished resistance to caffein in pathological
conditions was obtained by subjecting the suggestion to experimental
test, it was observed in these experiments on rabbits that death
occurred in some individuals after small doses which are usually not
even toxic. The findings at autopsy indicate the presence of pathological
conditions. The same was observed in some experiments on
cats and dogs. It is extremely probable, therefore, that disease
modifies the reaction of the organism to caffein as well as to other
drugs.<a href="#a78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>That the resistance to drugs may vary according to the age of the
subject has been maintained by a number of pharmacologists. According
to Guinard,<a href="#a30"><sup>30</sup></a> young dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs are very susceptible
to morphin, resembling children in this regard.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> The minimum
fatal dose for these animals is about one-third less than for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
adult. This is not true, however, for the young of other species.
Cats under 15 days of age tolerate twice the toxic dose of morphin
for the adult cat. Young beeves and goats are likewise more resistant
to this alkaloid than adults. On the other hand, according to Livon,<a href="#a54"><sup>54</sup></a>
young guinea pigs are more sensitive to alkaloids than adults. The
toxicity of caffein, as shown in the present investigation, was found
to be less in the young than in the adult. In dogs the young subjects
are in some instances almost twice as resistant as adults. The difference
was found to be less in cats and rabbits than in dogs, but it was
quite marked.</p>

<p>The effect of season on the toxicity of drugs has been discussed in
the section on the experiments on guinea pigs, which were more resistant
to caffein in the fall than in February and March. The effect
of season seems to vary with the animal, but it may also differ with the
substance employed. In Noe's<a href="#a65"><sup>65</sup></a> studies on this subject cantharidin
was found to be more toxic for the hedgehog in November than in
July. The effect of season was different for morphin, as it was
observed that the resistance of the hedgehog was greater at the end
of the summer than earlier in the season.</p>

<p>The relation of diet to toxicity of drugs has been studied by Hunt.<a href="#a39"><sup>39</sup></a>
His experiments indicate that this is an important factor in the resistance
to acetonitril. The studies here reported on the effect of diet
on toxicity of caffein in rabbits were confined to experiments with
oats and carrots and do not show any modification of the resistance
to caffein. The question of diet in chronic intoxication in dogs, however,
suggests that in these animals diet may affect the toxicity of
caffein, although the data on this subject are far from satisfactory.
There is nevertheless sufficient evidence to suggest that a high protein
diet for the adult dog tends to greater resistance of the animal to
caffein and similarly the growing dog tolerates larger quantities of
caffein on a milk diet than on a diet of meat.</p>

<p>This brings us to a consideration of the behavior of caffein in
chronic intoxication. Although in both rabbits and dogs absence of
cumulation was evident, in other respects decided differences in the
resistance to caffein were observed. While the rabbit tolerates more
than twice the single dose of caffein per kilo for the dog, the result is
quite different in repeated dosage of the drug, the rabbit succumbing
to continued administration of much smaller doses of the drug than
the dog. This is probably due to lesions of the gastro-intestinal canal
caused by caffein which occasions loss of appetite much more readily
in the rabbit than in the dog. The abundant energy reserve in the
dog makes it possible for this animal to stand inanition much longer
than the rabbit and other herbivora. The difference in the behavior
of the rabbit and dog toward caffein is interesting as showing complete
reversal of resistance in acute and chronic intoxication. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
statement in the introduction it is evident that the size of the single
toxic or lethal dose of a substance is in no wise an index of the active
degree of its toxicity. The experiments with caffein here reported
furnish additional evidence that this is true, at least for the rabbit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="GENERAL_SUMMARY_AND_CONCLUSIONS" id="GENERAL_SUMMARY_AND_CONCLUSIONS">GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.</a></h2>


<p>The toxicity of caffein in the rabbit varies with the mode of its
administration, being least when given by mouth and greatest by
intravenous administration. The toxicity is from 15 to 20 per cent
greater by subcutaneous injections than by mouth, but is about half
of that when injected into the peritoneal cavity. No difference was
observed in the toxicity of caffein whether administered into gluteal
or into the lumbar muscles. When introduced by this route the
toxicity was found to be less by one-third than when it is injected
into the peritoneal cavity, but is about 30 per cent more toxic than
the subcutaneous injections. White or black rabbits were found to
be less resistant to caffein than gray rabbits.</p>

<p>The resistance of the guinea pig to caffein, as of the rabbit, is
greatest when given by mouth. The minimum fatal dose is less by
intraperitoneal injections, but greater than by subcutaneous injections,
thus differing from the rabbit in this regard. The adult cat
is less resistant than the guinea pig or rabbit to caffein. The minimum
lethal dose by mouth is the same as by subcutaneous, and is
less than by intraperitoneal, injection. The minimum fatal dose
for dogs was found to be the same by mouth as by subcutaneous injection
and is almost the same as for the cat. The toxicity of caffein
varies in the guinea pig according to season of the year.</p>

<p>Age is likewise a factor in the toxicity of caffein, young animals
being more resistant than the full-grown and older animals; this was
shown in experiments on rabbits, cats, and dogs. The symptoms of
caffein poisoning also were different in puppies and in full-grown dogs.
Different diets, such as carrots and oats, did not influence the resistance
of rabbits and guinea pigs to caffein. Low protein diet tends
to decrease resistance to caffein in dogs. Young growing dogs are
less resistant to caffein on a meat than on a milk diet. Caffein is
not cumulative in the rabbit or dog, even if administered for a considerable
length of time. Some degree of tolerance may be induced
in the rabbit under certain conditions, but not in dogs under the
conditions of the experiments made in this investigation. The possibility,
however, that dogs may acquire tolerance for caffein is not
excluded. Although the rabbit tolerates a much larger single dose
of caffein than the dog, it was found, in experiments on chronic
intoxication that the rabbit is less resistant to caffein than the dog.
The toxicity of caffein is probably increased under pathological con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ditions,
since comparatively smaller doses were fatal to rabbits, cats,
and dogs, when marked lesions not due to caffein were found at
autopsy. Glycosuria was observed in rabbits, guinea pigs, and cats
when caffein was given in sufficient amounts.</p>
